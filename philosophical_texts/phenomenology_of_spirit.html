Accord-ingly, this process of knowing proceeds on the surface, does nottouch the thing itself, its essence or Notion, and therefore fails 26 PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT to comprehend it [i.e. in terms of its Notion].—The material,regarding which mathematics provides such a gratifying trea-sury of truths, is space and the numerical unit.

It might seem necessary at the outset to say more aboutthe method of this movement, i.e. of Science. But its Notion isalready to be found in what has been said, and its proper exposi-tion belongs to Logic, or rather it is Logic. For the method isnothing but the structure set forth in its pure essentiality. Weshould realize, however, that the system of ideas concerningphilosophical method is yet another set of current beliefs thatbelongs to a bygone culture. If this comment sounds boastfulor revolutionary—and I am far from adopting such a tone—it should be noted that current opinion itself has already cometo view the scientific regime bequeathed by mathematics asquite old-fashtoned—with its explanations, divisions, axioms, setsof theorems, its proofs, principles, deductions, and conclusionsfrom them. Even if its unfitness is not clearly understood, littleor no use is any longer made of it; and though not actuallycondemned outright, no one likes it very much. And we shouldbe sufficiently prejudiced in favour of what is excellent, to sup-pose that it will be put to use, and will find acceptance. Butit is not difficult to see that the way of asserting a proposition,adducing reasons for it, and in the same way refuting its oppo-site by reasons, is not the form in which truth can appear. Truthis its own self-movement, whereas the method just describedis the mode of cognition that remains external to its material.Hence it is peculiar to mathematics, and must be left to thatscience, which, as we have noted, has for its principle the rela-tionship of magnitude, a relationship alien to the Notion, andfor its material dead space and the equally lifeless numericalunit. This method, too, in a looser form, i.e. more blended withthe arbitrary and the accidental, may retain its place, as in con-versation, or in a piece of historical instruction designed ratherto satisfy curiosity than to produce knowledge, which is aboutwhat a preface amounts to.

Thus in what con-sciousness affirms from within itself as being-in-itself or the Truewe have the standard which consciousness itselfsets up by whichto measure what it knows. If we designate knowledge as theNotion, but the essence or the True as what exists, or the object,then the examination consists in seeing whether the Notion cor-responds to the object. But if we call the essence or in-itself ofthe object the Notion, and on the other hand understand by theobject the Notion itself as object, viz. as it exists for an other, thenthe examination consists in seeing whether the object corre- `sponds to its Notion. It is evident, of course, that the two pro-cedures are the same. But the essential point to bear in mindthroughout the whole investigation is that these two moments,‘Notion’ and ‘object’, ‘being-for-another’ and ‘being-in-itself’,both fall within that knowledge which we are investigating. 54 PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT Consequently, we do not need to import criteria, or to makeuse of our own bright ideas and thoughts during the courseof the inquiry; it is precisely when we leave these aside that wesucceed in contemplating the matter in hand as it is in and foritself."},{"number":85,"text":"But not only is a contribution by us supertiuous, sinceNotion and object, the criterion and what is to be tested, arepresent in consciousness itself, but we are also spared the troubleofcomparing the two and really ¢esting them, so that, since whatconsciousness examines is its own self, all that is left for us todo is simply to look on. For consciousness is, on the one hand,consciousness of the object, and on the other, consciousness ofitself; consciousness of what for it is the True, and consciousnessot its knowledge of the truth. Since both are for the same con-sciousness, this consciousness is itself their comparison; it is forthis same consciousness to know whether its knowledge of theobject corresponds to the object or not. The object, it is true,seems only to be for consciousness in the way that consciousnessknows it; it seems that consciousness cannot, as it were, getbehind the object as it exists for consciousness so as to examinewhat the object is in itself, and hence, too, cannot test its ownknowledge by that standard. But the distinction between thein-itself and knowledge is already present in the very fact thatconsciousness knows an object at all.Something is for it the in-itself; and knowledge, or the being of the object for conscious-ness, is, for it, another moment. Upon this distinction, whichis present as a fact, the examination rests. If the comparisonshows that these two moments do not correspond to oneanother, it would seem that consciousness must alter its know-ledge to make it conform to the object. But, in fact, in the altera-tion of the knowledge, the object itself alters for it too, for theknowledge that was present was essentially a knowledge of theobject: as the knowledge changes, so too does the object, forit essentially belonged to this knowledge. Hence it comes to passfor consciousness that what it previously took to be the in-itselfis not an in-itself, or that it was only an in-itself for consciousness.Since consciousness thus finds that its knowledge does not corre-spond to its object, the object itself does not stand the test; inother words, the criterion for testing is altered when that forwhich it was to have been the criterion fails to pass the test;"}]},{"name":"Introduction","paragraphs":[{"number":86,"text":"Inasmuch as the new true object issues from it, this dialecticalmovement which consciousness exercises on itself and whichaffects both its knowledge and its object, is precisely what iscalled experience [Erfahrung].

Consciousness knows something;this object is the essence or the zn-ztself; but it is also for con-sciousness the in-itself. This is where the ambiguity of this truthenters. We see that consciousness now has two objects: one isthe first zn-itself, the second is the being-for-consciousness of this in-itself. The latter appears at first sight to be merely the reflectionof consciousness into itself, i.e. what consciousness has in mindis not an object, but only its knowledge of that first object. But,as was shown previously, the first object, in being known, isaltered for consciousness; it ceases to be the in-itself, andbecomes something that is the zn-ztself only for consciousness.

It usually seems to be the case, on the contrary, thatour experience of the untruth of our first notion comes by wayof a second object which we come upon by chance and extern-ally, so that our part in all this is simply the pure apprehensionof what is in and for itself. From the present viewpoint, however,the new object shows itself to have come about through a reversalof consciousness itself. This way of looking at the matter is some-thing contributed by us, by means of which the succession ofexperiences through which consciousness passes is raised intoascientific progression—but it is not known to the consciousness 56 PHENOMENOLOGY OF SPIRIT that we are observing. But, as a matter of fact, we have herethe same situation as the one discussed in regard to the relationbetween our exposition and scepticism, viz. that in every casethe result of an untrue mode ofknowledge must not be allowedto run away into an empty nothing, but must necessarily begrasped as the nothing of that from which it results—a result whichcontains what was true in the preceding knowledge. It showsup here like this: since what first appeared as the object sinksfor consciousness to the level of its way of knowing it, and sincethe in-itself becomes a being-for-consciousness of the in-itself, thelatter is now the new object. Herewith a new pattern of con-sciousness comes on the scene as well, for which the essenceis something different from what it was at the preceding stage.It is this fact that guides the entire series of the patterns of con-sciousness in their necessary sequence. But it is just this neces-sity itself, or the origination of the new object, that presentsitself to consciousness without its understanding how thishappens, which proceeds for us, as it were, behind the backof consciousness. Thus in the movement of consciousness thereoccurs a moment of being-in-itself or being-for-us which is notpresent to the consciousness comprehended in the experienceitself. The content, however, of what presents itself to us doesexist for it; we comprehend only the formal aspect of that con-tent, or its pure origination.

Moreover, sense-certainty appears to be the truest know-ledge; for it has not as yet omitted anything from the object,but has the object before it in its perfect entirety.

Itis clear that the dialectic ofsense-certainty is nothingelse but the simple history of its movement or of its experience,and sense-certainty itself is nothing else but just this history.That is why the natural consciousness, too, is always reachingthis result, learning from experience what is true in it; butequally it is always forgetting it and starting the movement allover again. It is therefore astonishing when, in face of this ex- SENSE-CERTAINTY 65 perience, it is asserted as universal experience and put forward,too, as a philosophical proposition, even as the outcome ofScepticism, that the reality or being of external things takenas Thises or sense-objects has absolute truth for consciousness.To make such an assertion is not to know what one is saying,to be unaware that one is saying the opposite of what one wantstosay. The truth for consciousness of a This of sense is supposedto be universal experience; but the very opposite is universalexperience. Every consciousness itself supersedes such a truth,as e.g. Here is a tree, or, Now is noon, and proclaims the oppo-site: Here is not a tree, but a house; and similarly, it immediatelyagain supersedes the assertion which set aside the first so faras it is also just such an assertion of a sensuous This. And whatconsciousness will learn from experience in all sense-certaintyis, in truth, only what we have seen viz. the This as a universal,the very opposite of what that assertion affirmed to be universalexperience. With this appeal to universal experience we may be per-mitted to anticipate how the case stands in the practical sphere.In this respect we can tell those who assert the truth and cer-tainty of the reality of sense-objects that they should go backto the most elementary school of wisdom, viz. the ancient Eleu-sinian Mysteries of Ceres and Bacchus, and that they have still tolearn the secret meaning of the eating of bread and the drinkingof wine. For he who is initiated into these Mysteries not onlycomes to doubt the being of sensuous things, but to despair ofit; in part he brings about the nothingness of such things himselfin his dealings with them, and in part he sees them reduce them-selves to nothingness. Even the animals are not shut out fromthis wisdom but, on the contrary, show themselves to be mostprofoundly initiated into it; for they do not just stand idly infront ofsensuous things as if these possessed intrinsic being, but,despairing of their reality, and completely assured of theirnothingness, they fall to without ceremony and eat them up.And all Nature, like the animals, celebrates these open Mys-teries which teach the truth about sensuous things."},{"number":110,"text":"But, just as our previous remarks would suggest, thosewho put forward such an assertion also themselves say the directopposite of.what they mean: a phenomenon which is perhapsbest calculated to induce them to reflect on the nature of sense- 66 A.

Supersession exhibitsits true twofold meaning which we have seen in the negative:it is at once a negating and a preserving. Our Nothing, as the Noth-ing of the This, preserves its immediacy and is itself sensuous,but it is a universal immediacy. Being, however, is a universalin virtue ofits having mediation or the negative within it; whenit expresses this in its immediacy it is a differentiated, determinateproperty. As a result many such properties are established simul-taneously, one being the negative of another. Since they areexpressed in the simplicity of the universal, these deter-minacies—which are properties strictly speaking only throughthe addition of a further determination—are related [only] tothemselves; they are indifferent to one another, each is on itsown and free from the others. But the simple, self-identical uni-versality is itselfin turn distinct and free from these determinateproperties it has. It is pure relating of self to self, or the mediumin which all these determinacies are, and in which as a simpleunity they therefore interpenetrate, but without coming into con-tact with one another; for it is precisely through participatingin this universality that they exist indifferently on their ownaccount. This abstract universal medium, which can be called simply‘thinghood’ or ‘pure essence’, is nothing else than what Hereand Now have proved themselvess to be, viz. a simple togethernessof a plurality; but the many are, in their determinateness, simpleuniversals themselves. This salt is a simple Here, and at thesame time manifold; it is white and also tart, also cubical inshape, of a specific gravity, etc. All these many properties arein a single simple ‘Here’, in which, therefore, they inter-penetrate ; none has a different Here from the others, but eachis everywhere, in the same Here in which the others are. And,at the same time, without being separated by different Heres,they do not affect each other in this interpenetration. Thewhiteness does not affect the cubical shape, and neither affects PERCEPTION 69 the tart taste, etc.; on the contrary, since each is itself a simplerelating ofself to self it leaves the others alone, and is connectedwith them only by the indifferent Also. This Also is thus thepure universal itself, or the medium, the ‘thinghood’, whichholds them together in this way."},{"number":114,"text":"In the relationship which has thus emerged it is onlythe character of positive universality that is at first observedand developed; but a further side presents itself, which mustalso be taken into consideration. To wit, if the many determi-nate properties were strictly indifferent to one another, if theywere simply and solely self-related, they would not be determi-nate; for they are only determinate in so far as they differentiatethemselves from one another, and relate themselves to others asto their opposites. Yet; as thus opposed to one another theycannot be together in the simple unity of their medium, whichis Just as essential to them as negation; the differentiation ofthe properties, in so far as it is not an indifferent differentiationbut is exclusive, each property negating the others, thus fallsoutside of this simple medium; and the medium, therefore, isnot merely an Also, an indifferent unity, but a One as well, aunity which excludes an other. The One is the moment of negation ;it is itself quite simply a relation of self to self and it excludesan other; and it is that by which ‘thinghood’ is determined asa Thing. Negation is inherent in a property as a determinatenesswhich is immediately one with the immediacy of being, animmediacy which, through this unity with negation, is uni-versality. As a One, however, the determinateness is set freefrom this unity with its opposite, and exists in and for itself."},{"number":115,"text":"In these moments, taken together, the Thing as thetruth of perception is completed, so far as it is necessary to de-velop it here. It is (a) an indifferent, passive universality, theAlso of the many properties or rather ‘matters’; (b) negation,equally simply ; or the One, which excludes opposite properties ;and (c) the many properties themselves, the relation of the firsttwo moments, or negation as it relates to the indifferent ele-ment, and therein expands into a host of differences; the pointofsingular individuality in the medium of subsistence radiatingforth into plurality. In so far as these differences belong to theindifferent medium they are themselves universal, they arerelated only to themselves and do not affect one another. But 70 A. CONSCIOUSNESS in so far as they belong to the negative unity they are at thesame time exclusive [of other properties]; but they necessarilyhave this relationship of opposition to properties remote fromtheir Also. The sensuous universality, or the immediate unity ofbeing and the negative, is thus a property only when the Oneand the pure universality are developed from it and differenti-ated from each other, and when the sensuous universality unitesthem; it is this relation of the universality to the pure essentialmoments which at last completes the Thing."},{"number":116,"text":"This, then, is how the Thing of perception is con-stituted ; and consciousness is determined as percipient in so faras this Thing is its object. It has only to take it, to confine itselfto a pure apprehension of it, and what is thus yielded is theTrue. If consciousness itself did anything ip taking what isgiven, it would by such adding or subtraction alter the truth.Since the object is the True and universal, the self-identical,while consciousness is alterable and unessential, it can happenthat consciousness apprehends the object incorrectly anddeceives itself. The percipient is aware of the possibility of de-ception; for in the universality which is the principle, othernessitself is immediately present for him, though present as whatis null and superseded. His criterion of truth is therefore self-identity, and his behaviour consists in apprehending the objectas self-identical. Since at the same time diversity is explicitlythere for him, it is a connection of the diverse moments of hisapprehension to one another; but if a dissimilarity makes itselffelt in the course of this comparison, then this is not an untruthof the object—for this is the self-identical—but an untruth inperceiving it."},{"number":117,"text":"Let us see now what consciousness experiences in itsactual perceiving. For us, this experience is already containedin the development of the object, and of the attitude of con-sciousness towards it given just now. It is only a matter of de-veloping the contradictions that are present therein. The objectwhich I apprehend presents itself purely as a One; but I alsoperceive in it a property which is universal, and which therebytranscends the singularity [of the object]. The first being of theobjective essence as a One was therefore not its true being. Butsince the objectis what is true, the untruth falls in me; my appre-hension was not correct. On account of the universality of the PERCEPTION 7 property, I must rather take the objective essence to be on thewhole a community. I now further perceive the property to bedeterminate, opposed to another and excluding it. Thus I did notin fact apprehend the objective essence correctly when I definedit as a community with others, or as a continuity; on accountof the determinateness of the property, I must break up thecontinuity and posit the cbjective essence as a One thatexcludes. In the broken up One I find many such properties whichdo not affect one another but are mutually indifferent. There-fore, I did not perceive the object correctly when I apprehendedit as exclusive; on the contrary, just as previouly it was onlycontinuity in general, so now it is a universal common mediumin which many properties are present as sensuous universalities,each existing on its own account and, as determinate, excludingthe others. But this being so, what I perceive as the simple andthe True is also not a universal medium, but the single propertyby itself which, however, as such, is neither a property nor adeterminate being ; for now it is neither in a One nor connectedwith others. Only when it belongs to a One is it a property,and only in relation to others is it determinate. As this purerelating of itself to itself, it remains merely sensuous being ingeneral, since it no longer possesses the character of negativity ;and the consciousness which takes its object to be a sensuousbeing is only ‘my’ meaning [ein Meinen], i.e. it has ceased alto-gether to perceive and has withdrawn into itself. But sensuousbeing and my meaning themselves pass over into perception:I am thrown back to the beginning and drawn once again intothe same cycle which supersedes itself in each moment and asa whole."},{"number":118,"text":"Consciousness, therefore, necessarily runs through thiscycle again, but this time not in the same way as it did the firsttime. For it has experienced in perception that the outcomeand the truth of perception is its dissolution, or is reflection outof the True and into itself. Thus it becomes quite definite forconsciousness how its perceiving is essentially constituted,viz. that itis not a simple pure apprehension, but in its apprehen-sion is at the same time reflected out of the True and into itself. Thisreturn of consciousness into itself which is directly mingled withthe pure apprehension [of the object]—for this return into itself 72 A. CONSCIOUSNESS has shown itself to be essential to perception—alters the truth.Consciousness at once recognizes this aspect as its own and takesresponsibility for it; by doing so it will obtain the true objectin its purity. This being so, we have now in the case of percep-tion the same as.happened in the case of sense-certainty, theaspect of consciousness being driven back into itself; but not,in the first instance, in the sense in which this happened insense-certainty, i.e. not as if the truth of perception fell in con-sciousness. On the contrary, consciousness recognizes that it isthe ‘untruth occurring in perception that falls within it. But bythis very recognition it is able at once to supersede this untruth;it distinguishes its apprehension of the truth from the untruthof its perception, corrects this untruth, and since it undertakesto make this correction itself, the truth, gua truth of perception,falls of course within consciousness. The behaviour of conscious-ness which we have now to consider is thus so constituted thatconsciousness no longer merely perceives, but is also consciousofits reflection into itself, and separates this from simple appre-hension proper. 11g. At first, then, I become aware of the Thing as a One,and have to hold fast to it in this its true character; if, in thecourse of perceiving it, something turns up which contradictsit, this is to be recognized as a reflection of mine. Now, therealso occur in the perception various properties which seem tobe properties of the Thing; but the Thing is a One, and we areconscious that this diversity by which it would cease to be aOne falls in us. So in point of fact, the Thing is white only toour eyes, also tart to our tongue, also cubical to our touch, andso on. We get the entire diversity of these aspects, not from theThing, but from ourselves; and they fall asunder in this wayfor us, because the eye is quite distinct from the tongue, andso on. We are thus the universal medium in which such momentsare kept apart and exist each on its own. Through the fact, then,that we regard the characteristic of being a universal mediumas our reflection, we preserve the self-identity and truth of theThing, its being a One."},{"number":120,"text":"But, regarded as existing each for itself in the universalmedium, these diverse aspects for which consciousness accepts re-sponsibility are specifically determined. White is white only inopposition to black, and so on, and the Thing is a One precisely PERCEPTION 73 by being opposed to others. But it is not as a One that it excludesothers from itself, for to be a One is the. universal relating ofself to self, and the fact that it is a One rather makes it likeall the others; it is through its determinateness that the thingexcludes others. Things are therefore in and for themselvesdeterminate; they have properties by which they distinguishthemselves from others. Since the property [Eigenschaft] is theThing’s own [eigene] property or a determinateness in the Thingitself, the Thing has a number of properties. For, in the firstplace, the Thing is what is true, i.e. it possesses tntrinste being;and what is in it, is there as the Thing’s essence, and not onaccount of other things. Secondly, therefore, the determinateproperties do not only exist on account of other things and forother things, but in the Thing itself; yet they are determinateproperties in zt only because they are a plurality of reciprocallyself-differentiating elements. And thirdly, since this is how theyare in the ‘thinghood’ [i.e. the essence of the one thing of whichthey are properties], they exist in and for themselves, indifferenttoone another. Itisin truth, then, the Thing itself that is white,and also cubical, also tart, and so on. In other words, the Thingis the Also, or the universal medium in which the many propertiessubsist apart from one another, without touching or cancellingone another; and when so taken, the Thing is perceived as whatis true."},{"number":121,"text":"Now, in perceiving in this way, consciousness is at thesame time aware that it is also reflected into itself, and that,in perceiving, the opposite moment to the Also turns up. Butthis moment is the unity of the Thing with itself, a unity whichexcludes difference from itself. Accordingly, it is this unitywhich consciousness has to take upon itself; for the Thing itselfis the subsistence of the many diverse and independent properties. Thuswe say of the Thing: it is white, also cubical, and also tart, andso on. But zn so far as it is white, it is not cubical, and in so faras it is cubical and also white, it is not tart, and so on. Positingthese properties as a oneness is the work of consciousness alonewhich, therefore, has to prevent them from collapsing into one-ness in the Thing. To this end it brings in the ‘in so far’, inthis way preserving the properties as mutually external, andthe Thing as the Also. Quite rightly, consciousness makes itselfresponsible for the oneness, at first in such a way that what was 74 A. CONSCIOUSNESS called a property is represented as ‘free matter’. The Thing isin this way raised to the level of a genuine Also, since it becomesa collection of ‘matters’ and, instead of being a One, becomesmerely an enclosing surface."},{"number":122,"text":"If we look back on what consciousness previously took,and now takes, responsibility for, on what it previouslyascribed, and now ascribes, to the Thing, we see that conscious-ness alternately makes itself, as well as the Thing, into both apure, many-less One, and into an Also that resolves itself intoindependent ‘matters’. Consciousness thus finds through thiscomparison that not only its truthful perceiving [Nehmen desWahren], contains the distinct moments of apprehension and with-drawal into itself, but rather that the truth itself, the Thing,reveals itself in this twofold way. Our experience, then, is this,that the Thing exhibits itself for the consciousness apprehending it,in a specific manner, but is at the same time reflected out of theway in which it presents itself to consciousness and back intoitself; in other words, it contains in its own self an opposite truth[to that which it has for the apprehending consciousness]."},{"number":123,"text":"Thus consciousness has got beyond this second type ofattitude in perceiving, too, i.e. the one in which it takes theThing as truly self-identical, and itself for what is not self-identi-cal but returns back into itself out of identity. The object is nowfor consciousness this whole movement which was previouslyshared between the object and consciousness. The Thing is aOne, reflected into itself; it is for itself, but it is also for an other;and, moreover, it is an other on its own account, just because itis for an other. Accordingly, the Thing is for itself and also foran other, a being that is doubly differentiated but also a One;but the oneness contradicts this diversity. Hence consciousnesswould again have to assume responsibility for placing [thediversity] in the One and for keeping it away from the Thing.It would have'to say that in so far as it is for itself, the Thingis not for an other. But the oneness also belongs to the Thingitself as consciousness has found by experience: the Thing isessentially reflected into itself. The Also, or the indifferent dif-ference, thus falls as much within the Thing as does the oneness;but since the two are different they do not fall within the sameThing, but in different Things. The contradiction which ispresent in the objective essence as a whole is distributed PERCEPTION 75 between two objects. In and for itself the Thing is self-identical,but this unity with itself is disturbed by other Things. Thusthe unity of the Thing is preserved and at the same time theotherness is preserved outside of the Thing as well as outsideof consciousness."},{"number":124,"text":"Now, although it is true that the contradiction in theobjective essence is in this way distributed among differentThings, yet the difference will, for that reason, attach to thesingular separated Thing itself. The different Things are thusestablished as existing on their own account; and the conflictbetween them isso far reciprocal that each is different, not fromitself, but only from the other. But each is thereby determinedas being itselfa different Thing, and it has its essential differencein its own self; but all the while not as if this difference werean opposition in the Thing itself. On the contrary, for itself itis a simple determinateness which constitutes the Thing’s essentialcharacter, and differentiates it from others. As a matter of fact,since differentness is present in it, it is of course necessarilypresent as an actual difference manfoldly constituted. Butbecause the determinateness constitutes the essence of theThing, by which it distinguishes itself from other Things andis for itself, this further manifold constitution is the unessentialaspect. Consequently, the Thing does indeed have the. twofold‘in so far’ within its unity, but the aspects are unequal in value.As a result, this state of opposition does not develop into anactual opposition in the Thing itself, but in so far as the Thingthrough its absolute difference comes into a state of opposition,it is opposed to another Thing outside of it. Of course, thefurther manifoldness is necessarily present in the Thing too, sothat it cannot be left out; but it is the unessential aspect of theThing."},{"number":125,"text":"This determinateness, which constitutes the essentialcharacter of the Thing and distinguishes it from all others, isnow defined in such a way that the Thing is thereby in opposi-tion to other Things, but is supposed to preserve its indepen-dence in this opposition.

It is just through the absolute 76 A. CONSCIOUSNESS character of the Thing and its opposition that it relates itself toothers, and is essentially only this relating. The relation, how-ever, is the negation of its self-subsistence, and it is really theessential property of the Thing that is its undoing."},{"number":126,"text":"The conceptual necessity of the experience throughwhich consciousness discovers that the Thing is demolished bythe very determinateness that constitutes its essence and itsbeing-for-self, can be summarized as follows. The Thing isposited as being for itself, or as the absolute negation of all other-ness, therefore as purely se/f-related negation; but the negationthat is self-related is the suspension of itself; in other words, theThing has its essential being in another Thing."},{"number":127,"text":"In fact, the definition of the object, as it has emerged,has shown itself to contain nothing else. The object is definedas having within it an essential property which constitutes itssimple being-for-self; but along with this simple nature theobject is also to contain diversity which, though necessary, is notto constitute its essential determinateness. This, however, is adistinction that is still only nominal; the unessential, which isnone the less supposed to be necessary, cancels itself out. It iswhat has just been called the negation of itself."},{"number":128,"text":"With this, the last ‘in so far’ that separated being-for-self from being-for-another falls away; on the contrary, theobject is zn one and the same respect the opposite of itself: itis for itself,so far as it is for another, and it is for another, so far as it is for itsel f.It is for itself, reflected into itself, a One; but this ‘for-itself,this reflection into itself, this being a One, is posited in a unitywith its opposite, with its ‘being-for-another’, and hence onlyas cancelled ; in other words, this being-for-selfis just as unessen-tial as the only aspect that was supposed to be unessential, viz.the relationship to another."},{"number":129,"text":"Thus the object in its pure determinatenesses, or in thedeterminatenesses which were supposed to constitute its essen-tial being, is overcome just as surely as it was in its sensuousbeing. From a sensuous being it turned into a universal; butthis universal, since it originates in the sensuous, is essentially con-ditioned by it, and hence is not truly a self-identical universalityat all, but one afflicted with an opposition; for this reason the uni-versality splits into the extremes of singular individuality anduniversality, into the One of the properties, and the Also of the PERCEPTION 77 ‘free matters’. These pure determinatenesses seem to express theessential nature itself, but they are only a ‘being-for-self thatis burdened with a ‘being-for-another’. Since, however, bothare essentially in a single unity, what we now have is unconditionedabsolute universality, and consciousness here for the first time trulyenters the realm of the Understanding."},{"number":130,"text":"Thus the singular being of sense does indeed vanish inthe dialectical movement of immediate certainty and becomesuniversality, but it is only a sensuous universality.

But these twocontradictory extremes are not merely alongside each other butin a single unity, or in other words, the defining characteristiccommon to both, viz. ‘being-for-self, is burdened with opposi-tion generally, i.e. it is at the same time not a ‘being-for-self .The sophistry of perception seeks to save these moments fromtheir contradiction, and it seeks to lay hold on the truth, bydistinguishing between the aspects, by sticking to the ‘Also’ andto the ‘in so far’, and finally, by distinguishing the ‘unessential’aspect from an ‘essence’ which is opposed to it. But theseexpedients, instead of warding off deception in the process ofapprehension, prove themselves on the contrary to be quiteempty; and the truth which is supposed to be won by this logicof the perceptual process proves to be in one and the same re-spect the opposite [of itself] and thus to have as its essence auniversality which is devoid of distinctions and determinations."},{"number":131,"text":"These empty abstractions of a ‘singleness’ and a ‘uni-versality’ opposed to it, and of an ‘essence’ that is linked withsomething unessential—a ‘non-essential’ aspect which is neces-sary all the same—these are powers whose interplay is the per-ceptual understanding, often called ‘sound common sense’.This ‘sound common sense’ which takes itself to be a solid, real-istic consciousness is, in the perceptual process, only the playof these abstractions; generally, it is always at its poorest whereit fancies itself to be the richest. Bandied about by these vacuous‘essences’, thrown into the arms first of one and then of the 78 A. CONSCIOUSNESS other, and striving by its sophistry to hold fast and affirm altern-ately first one of the ‘essences’ and then the directly oppositeone, it sets itself against the truth and holds the opinion thatphilosophy is concerned only with mental entities. As a matterof fact, philosophy does have to do with them too, recognizingthem as the pure essences, the absolute elements and powers;but in doing so, recognizes them in their specific determinatenessas well, and is therefore master over them, whereas perceptualunderstanding [or ‘sound common sense’) takes them for thetruth and is led on by them from one error to another. It doesnot itself become conscious that it is simple essentialities of thiskind that hold sway over it, but fancies that it has always todo with wholly substantial material and content; just as sense-certainty is unaware that the empty abstraction of pure beingis its essence. But it is, in fact, these essentialities within whichperceptual understanding runs to and fro through every kindof material and content; they are the cohesive power and mas-tery over that content and they alone are what the sensuousis as essence for consciousness, they are what determines the rela-tions of the sensuous to it, and it is in them that the processof perception and of its truth runs its course. This course, a per-petual alternation of determining what is true, and then settingaside this determining, constitutes, strictly speaking, the steadyeveryday life and activity of perceptual consciousness, a con-sciousness which fancies itself to be moving in the realm of truth.It advances uninterruptedly to the outcome in which all theseessential essentialities or determinations are equally setaside; but in each single moment it is conscious only of this onedeterminateness as the truth, and then in turn of the opposite one.It does indeed suspect their unessentiality, and to save themfrom the danger threatening them it resorts to the sophistry ofasserting to be true what it has itself just declared to be untrue.What the nature of these untrue essences is really trying to get[perceptual] understanding to do is to bring together, andthereby supersede, the thoughts of those non-entities, thethoughts of that universality and singular being, of ‘Also’ and‘One’, of the essentiality that is necessarily linked to the unessen-tial moment, and of an unessential moment that yet is neces-sary. But the Understanding struggles to avoid doing this byresorting to ‘in so far as’ and to the various ‘aspects’, or by mak- FORCE AND THE UNDERSTANDING 79 ing itself responsible for one thought in order to keep the otherone isolated as the true one.

We have to see how thesemoments exhibit themselves in the unconditioned universalitywhich is their essence.

That within itself the universalis in undivided unity with this plurality means, however, thatthese ‘matters’ are each where the other is; they mutually inter-penetrate, but without coming into contact with one anotherbecause, conversely, the many diverse ‘matters’ are equally in-dependent. This also means that they are absolutely porous,or are sublated. This sublation in its turn, this reduction of thediversity to a pure being-for-self, is nothing other than themedium itself, and this is the independence of the different ‘mat-ters’. In oher words, the ‘matters’ posited as independentdirectly pass over into their unity, and their unity directly un-folds its diversity, and this once again reduces itself to unity.But this movement is what is called Force. One of its moments,the dispersal of the independent ‘matters’ in their [immediate]being, is the expression of Force; but Force, taken as that in whichthey have disappeared, is Force proper, Force which has beendriven back into itself from its expression.

In point of fact, however, Force is the unconditioneduniversal which is equally in its own self what it is for an other;or which contains the difference in its own self—for differenceis nothing else than being-for-another. In order, then, that Forcemay in truth be, it must be completely set free from thought,it must be posited as the substance of these differences, i.e. firstthe substance, as this whole Force, remaining essentially in andfor itself, and then its differences as possessing substantial being, oras moments existing on their own account. Force as such, oras driven back into itself, thus exists on its own account as anexclusive One, for which the unfolding of the [different] ‘matters’is another subsisting essence; and thus two distinct independentaspects are set up. But Force is also the whole, i.e. it remainswhat it is according to its Notion; that is to say, these differencesremain pure forms, superficial vanishing moments. At the sametime there would be no difference at all between Force properwhich has been driven back into itself, and Force unfolded intoindependent ‘matters’, if they had no enduring being, or, therewould be no Force if it did not exist in these opposite ways.But that it does exist in these opposite ways simply meansthat the two moments are at the same time themselves in-dependent. It is therefore this movement of the two momentsin which they perpetually give themselves independenceand then supersede themselves again which we are now toconsider. In general, it is clear that this movement is nothing else thanthe movement of perceiving, in which the two sides, the per-cipient and what is perceived, are indistinguishably one in theapprehension of the True, and yet each side is at the same timeequally reflected into itself, or has a being of its own. Here, thesetwosidesare moments of Force; they are just as much ina unity,as this unity, which appears as the middle term over againstthe independent extremes, is a perpetual diremption of itself FORCE AND THE UNDERSTANDING 83 into just these extremes which exist only through this process.Thus the movement which previously displayed itself as the self-destruction of contradictory Notions here has objective form andis the movement of Force, the outcome of which is the un-conditioned universal as something not objective, or as the innerbeing of Things."},{"number":137,"text":"Force, as thus determined, since it is conceived as Forceor as reflected into itself, is one side of its Notion, but posited asasubstantial extreme and, moreover, with the express characterof a One. The subsistence of the unfolded ‘matters’ outside ofForce is thus precluded and is something other than Force.Since it is necessary that Force itself be this subsistence, or thatit express itself, its expression presents itself in this wise, that thesaid ‘other’ approaches it and solicits it. But, as a matter of fact,since its expression is necessary, what is posited as another essenceis in Force itself. We must retract the assertion that Force isposited as a One, and that its essence is to express itself as an‘other’ which approaches it externally. Force is rather itself thisuniversal medium in which the moments subsist as ‘matters’;or, in other words, Force has expressed itself, and what was sup-posed to be something else soliciting it is really Force itself. Itexists, therefore, now as the medium of the unfolded ‘matters’.But equally essentially it has the form of the supersession of thesubsisting ‘matters’, or is essentially a One. Consequently, thisoneness, since Force is posited as the medium of the ‘matters’,is now something other than Force, which has this its essence out-side of it. But, since Force must of necessity be this onenesswhich it is not as yet posited as being, this ‘other’ approaches it,soliciting it to reflect itself into itself: in other words, Forcesupersedes its expression. But in fact Force is itself this reflected-ness-into-self, or this supersession of the expression. The one-ness, in the form in which it appeared, viz. as an ‘other’,vanishes; Force is this ‘other’ itself, is Force that is driven backinto itself."},{"number":138,"text":"What appears as an ‘other’ and solicits Force, both toexpression and to a return into itself, directly proves to be itselfForce; for the ‘other’ shows itself to be as much a universalmedium as a One, and in such a way that each of these formsat the same time appears only as a vanishing moment. Con-sequently, Force, in that there is an ‘other’ for it, and it is for 84 A. CONSCIOUSNESS an ‘other’, has not yet altogether emerged from its Notion.There are at the same time two Forces present; the Notion ofboth is no doubt the same, but it has gone forth from its unityinto a duality. Instead of the antithesis remaining entirely andessentially only a moment, it seems, by its self-diremption intotwo wholly independent forces, to have withdrawn from the con-trolling unity. We have now to see more closely the implicationsof this independence. ; In the first place, the second Force appears as the one thatsolicits and, moreover, in accordance with its content, as theuniversal medium in relation to the Force characterized as theone solicited. But since the second Force is essentially analternation of these two moments and is itself Force, it is likewisethe universal medium only through its being solicited to be such; andsimilarly, too, it is a negative unity, i.e. it solicits the retractionof Force [into itself], only through its being solicited to do so. Con-sequently, this distinction, too, which obtained between the twoForces, one of which was supposed to be the soliciting, the otherthe solicited, Force is transformed into the same reciprocalinterchange of the determinatenesses."},{"number":139,"text":"The interplay of the two Forces thus consists in theirbeing determined as mutually opposed, in their being for oneanother in this determination, and in the absolute, immediatealternation of the determinations—consists, i.e. in a transitionthrough which alone these determinations are in which theForces seem to make an independent appearance. The solicitingForce, e.g., is posited as a universal medium, and the one soli-cited, on the other hand, as Force driven back into itself; butthe former is a universal medium only through the other beingForce that is driven back into itself; or, it is really the latter thatis the soliciting Force for the other and is what makes it amedium. The first Force has its determinateness only throughthe other, and solicits only in so far as the other solicits it tobe a soliciting Force; and, just as directly, it loses the deter-minateness given to it, for this passes over—or rather hasalready passed over—to the other. The external, solicitingForce appears as a universal medium, but only through its hav-ing been solicited by the other Force to do so; but this meansthat the latter gives it that character and is really itself essentiallya universal medium; it gives the soliciting Force this character FORCE AND THE UNDERSTANDING 85 just because this other determination is essential to it, i.e.because this is really its own self."},{"number":140,"text":"To complete our insight into the Notion of this move-ment it may further be noticed that the differences themselvesare exhibited in a twofold difference: once as a difference ofcontent, one extreme being the Force reflected into itself, but theother the medium of the ‘matters’; and again as a differenceof form, since one solicits and the other is solicited, the formerbeing active and the other passive. According to the differenceof content they are distinguished [merely] in principle, or forus; but according to the difference of form they are independentand in their relation keep themselves separate and opposed toone another. The fact that the extremes, from the standpointofboth these sides, are thus nothing in themselves, that these sidesin which their different essences were supposed to consist areonly vanishing moments, are an immediate transition of eachinto its opposite, this truth becomes apparent to consciousnessin its perception of the movement of Force. But for us, asremarked above, something more was apparent, viz. that thedifferences, qua differences of content and form, vanished in them-selves; and on the side of form, the essence of the active, solicitingor independent side, was the same as that which, on the side ofcontent, presented itself as Force driven back into itself; theside which was passive, which was solicited or for an other, was,from the side of form, the same as that which, from the sideof content, presented itself as the universal medium of the many‘matters’."},{"number":141,"text":"From this wesee that the Notion of Force becomes actualthrough its duplication into two Forces, and how it comes tobe so. These two Forces exist as independent essences; but theirexistence is a movement of each towards the other, such thattheir being is rather a pure positedness or a being that is positedby an other, i.e. their being has really the significance of a sheervanishing. They do not exist as extremes which retain for them-selves something fixed and substantial, transmitting to oneanother in their middie term and in their contact a merelyexternal property; on the contrary, what they are, they are,only in this middle term and in this contact. In this, there isimmediately present both the repression within itself of Force,or its being-for-self, as well as its expression: Force that solicits 86 A. CONSCIOUSNESS and Force that is solicited. Consequently, these moments arenot divided into two independent extremes offering each otheronly an opposite extreme: their essence rather consists simplyand solely in this, that each zs solely through the other, andwhat each thus is it immediately no longer is, since it zs theother. They have thus, in fact, no substances of their own whichmight support and maintain them. The Notion of Force ratherpreserves itself as the essence in its very actuality; Force, as actual,exists simply and solely in its expression, which at the same timeis nothing else than a supersession of itself. This actual Force,when thought of as free from its expression and as being foritself, is Force driven back into itself; but in fact this deter-minateness, as we have found, is itself only a moment of Force’sexpression. Thus the truth of Force remains only the thought ofit; the moments ofits actuality, their substances and their move-ment, collapse unresistingly into an undifferentiated unity, aunity which is not Force driven back into itself (for this is itselfonly such a moment), but is its Notion qua Notion. Thus the real-ization of Force is at the same time the loss of reality; in thatrealization it has really become something quite different, viz.this universality, which the Understanding knows at the outset,or immediately, to be its essence and which also proves itselfto be such in the supposed reality of Force, in the actual sub-stances."},{"number":142,"text":"In so far as we regard the first universal as the Under-standing’s Notion in which Force is not yet for itself, the secondis now Force’s essence as it exhibits itself in and for itself.

The first universalwould be Force driven back into itself, or Force as Substance;the second, however, is the inner being of things qua inner, whichis the same as the Notion of Force gua Notion."},{"number":143,"text":"This true essence of Things has now the character ofnot being immediately for consciousness; on the contrary, con-sciousness has a mediated relation to the inner being and, asthe Understanding, looks through this mediating play of Forces intothe true background of Things.

This ‘being’ is therefore calledappearance; for we call being that is directly and in its own selfa non-being a surface show. But it is not merely a surface show;it is appearance, a totality of show. This totality, as totality oras a universal, is what constitutes the inner [of Things], the playof Forces as a reflection of the inner into itself. In it, the Thingsof perception are expressly present for consciousness as they arein themselves, viz. as moments which immediately and withoutrest or stay turn into their opposite, the One immediately intothe universal, the essential immediately into the unessential,and vice versa. This play of Forces is consequently the de-veloped negative; but its truth is the positive, viz. the universal,the object that, zn itself, possesses being. The being of this objectfor consciousness is mediated by the movement of appearance,in which the being of perception and the sensuously objective ingeneral has a merely negative significance. Consciousness,therefore, reflects itself out of this movement back into itself asthe True; but, gua consciousness, converts this truth again intoan objective inner, and distinguishes this reflection of Thingsfrom its own reflection into itself: just as the movement ofmediation is likewise still objective for it. This inner is, there-fore, for consciousness an extreme over against it; but it is forconsciousness the True, since in the inner, as the in-itself, it pos-sesses at the same time the certainty of itself, or the momentof its being-for-self. But it is not yet conscious of this groundor basis, for the being-for-self which the inner was supposed topossess in its own self would be nothing else but the negativemovement.

Certainly, we have no knowledgeof this inner world as it is here in its immediacy; but not becauseReason is too short-sighted or is limited, or however else onelikes to call it—on this point, we know nothing as yet becausewe have not yet gone deep enough—but because of the simplenature of the matter in hand, that is to say, because in the voidnothing is known, or, expressed from the other side, just becausethis inner world is determined as the beyond of consciousness.The result is, of course the same if a blind man is placed amidthe wealth of the supersensible world (if it has such wealth,whether it be its own peculiar content, or whether consciousnessitself be this content), and if one with sight is placed in puredarkness, or if you like, in pure light, just supposing the super-sensible world to be this. The man with sight sees as little inthat pure light as in pure darkness, and just as much as theblind man, in the abundant wealth which lies before him. Ifno further significance attached to the inner world and to ourclose link with it through the world ofappearance, then nothingwould be left to us but to stop at the world of appearance, i.e.to perceive something as true which we know is not true.

The con-nection of the Understanding with the inner world through themediation is, however, its own movement through which theinner world will fill itself out for the Understanding. What isimmediate for the Understanding is the play of Forces; but whatis the True for it, is the simple inner world. The movement ofForce is therefore the True, likewise only as something alto-gether simple. We have seen, however, that this play of Forcesis so constituted that the Force which is solicited by anotherForce is equally the soliciting Force for that other, which onlythereby becomes itself a soliciting Force. What is present in thisinterplay is likewise merely the immediate alternation, or theabsolute interchange, of the determinateness which constitutes thesole content of what appears: to be either a universal medium, go A. CONSCIOUSNESS or a negative unity. It ceases immediately on its appearancein determinate form to be what it was on appearing ; by appear-ing in determinate form, it solicits the other side to express itself,i.e. the latter is now immediately what the first was supposedto be. Each of these two sides, the relation of soliciting and therelation of the opposed determinate content, is on its own accountan absolute reversal and interchange [of the determinateness].But these two relations themselves are again one and the same;and the difference of form, of being the solicited and the solicit-ing Force, is the same as the difference of content, of being thesolicited Force as such, viz. the passive medium on the onehand, and the soliciting Force, the active, negative unity or theOne, on the other. In this way there vanishes completely alldistinction of separate, mutually contrasted Forces which weresupposed to be present in this movement, for they rested solelyon those distinctions; and the distinction between the Forces,along with both those distinctions, likewise collapses into onlyone. Thus there is neither Force, nor the act of soliciting orbeing solicited, nor the determinateness of being a stablemedium and a unity reflected into itself, there is neither some-thing existing singly by itself, nor are there diverse antitheses ;on the contrary, what there is in this absolute flux is only dif-ference as a universal difference, or as a difference into which themany antitheses have been resolved. This difference, as a uni-versal difference, is consequently the simple element in the play ofForce itself and what is true in it. It is the law of Force."},{"number":149,"text":"The absolute flux of appearance becomes a simple dif-Jerence through its relation to the simplicity of the inner worldor of the Understanding.

Inother words, negation is an essential moment of the universal,and negation, or mediation in the universal, is therefore a uni-versal difference. This difference is expressed in the law, whichis the stable image of unstable appearance. Consequently, thesupersensible world is an inert realm of laws which, though beyond FORCE AND THE UNDERSTANDING gi the perceived world—for this exhibits law only through incess-ant change—is equally present in it and is its direct tranquilimage."},{"number":150,"text":"This realm of laws is indeed the truth for the Under-standing, and that truth has its content in the law. At the sametime, however, this realm is only the initial truth for the Under-standing and does not fill out the world of appearance. In thisthe law is present, but is not the entire presence of appearance;with every change of circumstance the law has a different actu-‘ality. Thus appearance retains for itself an aspect which is notin the inner world; i.e. appearance is not yet truly posited asappearance, as a superseded being-for-self. This defect in the lawmust equally be made manifest in the law itself. What seemsto be defective in it is that while it does contain difference, thedifference is universal, indeterminate. However, in so far as itis not law in general, but a law, it does contain determinateness;consequently, there are indefinitely many laws. But this pluralityis itself rather a defect; for it contradicts the principle of theUnderstanding for which, as consciousness of the simple innerworld, the True is the implicitly universal unity. It must there-fore let the many laws collapse into one law, just as, e.g., thelaw by which a stone falls, and the law by which the heavenlybodies move, have been grasped as one law. But when the lawsthus coincide, they lose their specific character. The lawbecomes more and more superficial, and as a result what isfound is, in fact, not the unity of these specific laws, but a lawwhich leaves out their specific character; just as the one lawwhich combines in itself the laws of falling terrestrial bodies andof the motions of the heavenly bodies, in fact expresses neitherlaw. The unification of all laws in universal attraction expressesno other content than just the mere Notion of law itself, whichis posited in that law in the form of being. Universal attractionmerely asserts that everything has a constant difference in relation toother things. The Understanding imagines that in this unifica-tion it has found a universal law which expresses universalreality as such; but in fact it has only found the Notion of lawitself, although in such a way that what it is saying is that allreality is in its own self, conformable to law. The expression, uni-versal attraction, is of great importance in so far as it is directedagainst the thoughtless way in which everything is pictured as g2 A. CONSCIOUSNESS contingent, and for which determinateness has the form of sen-suous independence."},{"number":151,"text":"Thus, in contrast to specific laws, we have universalattraction, or the pure Notion of law. In so far as this pureNotion is looked on as the essence, or the true inner being, thedeterminateness of the specific law itself still belongs to appear-ance, or rather to sensuous being. But the pure Notion of lawtranscends not merely the law which, being itself a specific law,stands contrasted with other specific laws, but also transcendslaw as such. The determinateness of which we spoke is itself.really only a vanishing moment which can no longer occur hereas something essential, for here it is only the law that is the True;but the Notion of law is turned against law itself. That is to say,in the law the difference itself is grasped immediately and takenup into the universal, thereby, however, giving the momentswhose relation is expressed by the law a subsistence in the formof indifferent and [merely] implicit essentialities. But theseparts of the difference present in the law are at the same timethemselves determinate sides; the pure Notion of law as uni-versal attraction must, to get its true meaning, be grasped insuch a way that in it, as what is absolutely simple or unitary,the differences present in law as such themselves return againinto the inner world as a simple unity. This unity is the inner necessityof the law."},{"number":152,"text":"Thelawisthereby present in a twofold manner: once, aslaw in which the differences are expressed as independent mom-ents; and also in the form ofa simple withdrawal into itself whichagain can be called Force, but in the sense not of a Force that isdrivenbackintoitself, but Forceassuch, or the Notion of Force, anabstraction which absorbs the differences themselves of whatattracts and what is attracted. In this sense, simple electricity,e.g., is Force; but the expression of difference falls within thelaw; this difference is positive and negative electricity. In thecase of the motion of falling, Force is the simple factor, gravity,whose law is that the magnitudes of the different moments ofthe motion, the time elapsed and the space traversed, are relatedto one another as root and square. Electricity itself is not dif-ference per se, or is not in its essence the dual essence of positiveand negative electricity ; hence, it is usually said that it Aas thelaw of this mode of being, and, too, that it has the property of FORCE AND THE UNDERSTANDING 93 expressing itself in this way. It is true that this property is theessential and sole property of this Force, or that it belongs toit necessarily. But necessity here is an empty word; Force must,just because it must, duplicate itself in this way. Of course, givenpositive electricity, negative too is given in principle; for the posi-tive is, only as related to a negative, or, the positive is zn itsown self the difference from itself; and similarly with the nega-tive. But that electricity as such should divide itself in this wayis not in itselfa necessity. Electricity, as simple Force, is indifferentto its law—to be positive and negative ; and if we call the formerits Notion but the latter its being, then its Notion is indifferentto its being. It merely has this property, which just means thatthis property is not in itself necessary to it. This indifference isgiven another form when it is said that to be positive and nega-tive belongs to the definition of electricity, and that this is simplyits Notion and essence. In that case, its being would simply meanits actual existence. But that definition does not contain thenecessity of its existence; it exists, either because we find it, i.e. itsexistence is not necessary at all, or else it exists through, or bymeans of, other Forces, i.e. its necessity is an external necessity.But, in basing this necessity on the determinateness of beingthrough another, we relapse again into the plurality of specific lawswhich we have just left behind in order to consider law as law.It is only with law as law that we are to compare its Notionas Notion, or its necessity. But in all these forms, necessity hasshown itself to be only an empty word."},{"number":153,"text":"There is still another form than that just indicated inwhich the indifference oflaw and Force, or of Notion and being,is to be found. In the law of motion, e.g., it is necessary thatmotion be split up into time and space, or again, into distanceand velocity. Thus, since motion is only the relation of thesefactors, it—the universal—is certainly divided in its own self: Butnow these parts, time and space, or distance and velocity, donot in themselves express this origin in a One; they are in-different to one another, space is thought of as able to be with-out time, time without space, and distance at least withoutvelocity—just as their magnitudes are indifferent to oneanother, since they are not related to one another as positive andnegative, and thus are not related to one another through theirown essential nature. The necessity of the division is thus certainly 94 A. CONSCIOUSNESS present here, but not the necessity of the parts as such for oneanother. But it is just for this reason that that first necessity,too, is itself only a sham, false necessity. For motion is not itselfthought of as something simple, or as a pure essence, but asalready divided ; time and space are in themselves its independentparts or essences, or, distance and velocity are modes of beingor ways of thinking, either of which can well be without theother; and motion is, therefore, only their superficial relation,not their essence. If it is thought of as a simple essence or asForce, motion is no doubt gravity, but this does not contain thesedifferences at all."},{"number":154,"text":"The difference, then, in both cases is not a differencein its own self: either the universal, Force, is indifferent to thedivision which is the law, or the differences, the parts, of thelaw are indifferent to one another. The Understanding, how-ever, has the Notion of this implicit difference just because the lawis, on the one hand, the inner, implicit being, but is, at the sametime, inwardly differentiated. That this difference is thus aninner difference follows from the fact that the law is a simple Forceor is the Notion of the difference, and is therefore a differencebelonging to the Notion. But this inner difference still falls, tobegin with, only within the Understanding, and is rot yetposited in the thing itself. It is, therefore, only its own necessitythat is asserted by the Understanding; the difference, then, isposited by the Understanding in such a way that, at the sametime, it is expressly stated that the difference is not a differencebelonging to the thing itself. This necessity, which is merely verbal,is thus a recital of the moments constituting the cycle of thenecessity. The moments are indeed distinguished, but, at thesame time, their difference is expressly said to be not a differenceof the thing itself, and consequently is itself immediately can-celled again. This process is called ‘explanation’. A law is enunci-ated; from this, its implicitly universal element or ground isdistinguished as Force; but it is said that this difference is nodifference, rather that the ground is constituted exactly thesame as the law. The single occurrence of lightning, e.g., isapprehended as a universal, and this universal is enunciatedas the /aw of electricity; the ‘explanation’ then condenses thelaw into Force as the essence of the law. This Force, then, is soconstituted that when it is expressed, opposite electricities appear, FORCE AND THE UNDERSTANDING 95 which disappear again into one another; that is, Force is con-stituted exactly the same as law; there is said to be no differencewhatever between them. The differences are the pure, universalexpression of law, and pure Force; but both have the same con-tent, the same constitution. Thus the difference qua differenceof content, of the thing, is also again withdrawn."},{"number":155,"text":"In this tautological movement, the Understanding, aswe have seen, sticks to the inert unity ofits object, and the move-ment falls only within the Understanding itself, not within theobject. It is an explanation that not only explains nothing, butis so plain that, while it pretends tosay something different fromwhat has already been said, really says nothing at all but onlyrepeats the same thing. In the Thing itself this movement givesrise to nothing new; it comes into consideration [only] as amovement of the Understanding. In it, however, we detect thevery thing that was missing in the law, viz. the absolute fluxitself; for this movement, when we look at it more closely, isdirectly the opposite ofitself. That is to say, it posits a differencewhich is not only nota difference for us, but one which the move-ment itself cancels as a difference. This is the same flux whichpresented itself as the play of Forces. This contained the dis-tinction of soliciting and solicited Force, or Force expressingitself and Force repressed into itself; but these were distinctionswhich in reality were no distinctions, and therefore were alsoimmediately cancelled again. What is present here is not merelybare unity in which no difference would be posited, but rather amovement in which a distinction is certainly made but, because it isno distinction, is again cancelled. In the process, then, of explain-ing, the to and fro of change which before was outside ofthe inner world and present only in the appearance, has pene-trated into the supersensible world itself. Our consciousness,however, has passed over from the inner being as object to theother side, into the Understanding, and it experiences changethere."},{"number":156,"text":"Thus this change is not yet a change of the thing itself,but rather presents itself as pure change by the very fact thatthe content of the momentsofchange remains the same.

The Understanding thus learns that g6 A. CONSCIOUSNESS it is a law of appearance itself, that differences arise which areno differences, or that what is selfsame repels itself from itself;and similarly, that the differences are only such as are in realityno differences and which cancel themselves; in other words,what is not selfsame is self-attractive. And thus we have a secondlaw whose content is the opposite of what was previously calledlaw, viz. difference which remains constantly selfsame; for thisnew law expresses rather that like becomes unlike and unlikebecomes like. The Notion demands of the thoughtless thinker‘that he bring both laws together and become aware of theirantithesis. The second is certainly also a law, an inner self-identical being, but a selfsameness rather of the unlike, a per-manence of impermanence. In the play of Forces this lawshowed itself to be precisely this absolute transition and purechange; the selfsame, viz. Force, splits into an antithesis whichat first appears to be an independent difference, but which infact proves to be none; for it is the selfsame which repels itself fromitself, and therefore what is repelled is essentially self-attractive,for it is the same; the difference created, since it is no difference,therefore cancels itself again. Consequently, the differenceexhibits itself as difference of the thing itself or as absolute dif-ference, and this difference of the thing is thus nothing else butthe selfsame that has repelled itself from itself, and thereforemerely posits an antithesis which is none."},{"number":157,"text":"Through this principle, the first supersensible world,the tranquil kingdom of laws, the immediate copy of the per-ceived world, is changed into its opposite.

Whatin the law of the first is the north pole of the magnet is, in itsother, supersensible in-itself [ viz. in the earth], the south pole;but what is there south pole is here north pole. Similarly, whatin the first law is the oxygen pole of electricity becomes in itsother, supersensible essence, hydrogen pole; and conversely,what is there the hydrogen pole becomes here the oxygen pole.In another sphere, revenge on an enemy is, according to theimmediate law, the supreme satisfaction of the injured individu-ality. This law, however, which bids me confront him as him-self a person who does not treat me as such, and in fact bidsme destroy him as an individuality—this law is turned round bythe principle of the other world into its opposite: the reinstate-ment of myself as a person through the destruction of the alienindividuality is turned into self-destruction. If, now, this in-version, which finds expression in the punishment of crime, ismade into a law, it, too, again is only the law of one world whichis confronted by an inverted supersensible world where what isdespised in the former is honoured, and what in the former ishonoured, meets with contempt. The punishment which underthe law of the first world disgraces and destroys a man, is trans-formed in its inverted world into the pardon which preserves hisessential being and brings him to honour."},{"number":159,"text":"Looked at superficially, this inverted world is the oppo-site of the first in the sense that it has the latter outside of itand repels that world from itself as an inverted actual world: thatthe one is appearance, but the other the in-itself; that the oneis the world as it is for an other, whereas the other is the worldas it is for itself. So that to use the previous examples, whattastes sweet is really, or inwardly in the thing, sour; or what isnorth pole in the actual magnet in the world of appearance,would be south pole in the inner or essential being; what presents 98 A. CONSCIOUSNESS itself as oxygen pole in the phenomenon of electricity wouldbe hydrogen pole in unmanifested electricity. Or, an actionwhich in the world of appearance is a crime would, in the innerworld, be capable of being really good (a bad action may bewell-intentioned) ; punishment is punishment only in the worldof appearance; in itself, or in another world, it may be a benefitfor the criminal. But such antitheses of inner and outer, ofappearance and the supersensible, as of two different kinds ofactuality, we no longer find here. The repelled differences arenot shared afresh between two substances such as would supportthem and lend them a separate subsistence: this would resultin the Understanding withdrawing from the inner world andrelapsing into its previous position. The one side, or substance,would be the world of perception again in which one of thetwo laws would be operative, and confronting it would be aninner world, just such a sense-world as the first, but in the imagina-tion; it could not be exhibited as a sense-world, could not beseen, heard, or tasted, and yet it would be thought of as sucha sense-world. But, in fact, if the one posited world is a perceivedworld, and its in-itself, as its inversion, is equally thought of assensuous, then sourness which would be the in-itself of the sweetthing is actually a thing just as much as the latter, viz. a sourthing; black, which would be the in-itself of white, is an actualblack; the north pole which is the in-itself of the south pole isthe north pole actually present in the same magnet; the oxygen polewhich is the in-itself of the hydrogen pole is actually present inthe same voltaic pile. The actual crime, however, has its inversionand its in-itself as possibility, in the intention as such, but not ina good intention; for the truth ofintention is only the act itself.But the crime, as regards its content, has its reflection-into-self,or its inversion, in the actual punishment; this is the reconcilia-tion of the law with the actuality opposed to it in the crime.Finally, the actual punishment has its inverted actuality presentin it in such a way that the punishment is an actualization ofthe law, whereby the activity exercised by the law as punish-ment suspends itself, and, from being active, the law becomesagain quiescent and is vindicated, and the conflict of individu-ality with it, and of it with individuality, is extinguished.160. From the idea, then, of inversion, which constitutes theessential nature of one aspect of the supersensible world, we FORCE AND THE UNDERSTANDING 99 must eliminate the sensuous idea of fixing the differences in adifferent sustaining element; and this absolute Notion of the dif-ference must be represented and understood purely as inner dif-ference, a repulsion of the selfsame, as selfsame, from itself, andlikeness of the unlike as unlike. We have to think pure change,or think antithesis within the antithesis itself, or contradiction. For inthe difference which is an inner difference, the opposite is notmerely one of two—if it were, it would simply de, without beingan opposite—but it is the opposite of an opposite, or the otheris itselfimmediately present in it. Certainly, I put the ‘opposite’here, and the ‘other’ of which it is the opposite, there; the ‘oppo-site’, then, is on one side, is in and for itself without the ‘other’.But just because I have the ‘opposite’ here in and for itself, it is theopposite of itself, or it has, in fact, the ‘other’ immediatelypresent in it. Thus the supersensible world, which is the invertedworld, has at the same time overarched the other world andhas it within it; it is for itself the inverted world, i.e. the inversionof itself; it is itself and its opposite in one unity. Only thus isit difference as inner difference, or difference in its own self, ordifference as an infinity."},{"number":161,"text":"We see that through infinity, law completes itself intoan immanent necessity, and all the moments of [the world of]appearance are taken up into the inner world.

(b) What is thus dirempted, which constitutesthe parts thought of as in the law, exhibits itself as a stable exist-ence; and if the parts are considered without the Notion of theinner difference, then space and time, or distance and velocity,which appear as moments of gravity, are just as indifferent andwithout a necessary relation to one another as to gravity itself,or, as this simple gravity is indifferent to them, or, again, assimple electricity is indifferent to positive and negative elec-tricity.

It is self-zdentical, for thedifferences are tautological; they are differences that are none.This self-identical essence is therefore related only to itself; ‘toitself implies relationship to an ‘other’, and the relation-to-selfis rather a self-sundering ; or, in other words, that very self-identi-calness is an inner difference. These sundered moments are thusin and for themselves each an opposite—of an other; thus in eachmoment the ‘other’ is at the same time expressed; or each isnot the opposite of an ‘other’ but only a pure opposite; and soeach is therefore in its own self the opposite of itself. In otherwords, it is not an opposite at all, but is purely for itself, a pure,self-identical essence that has no difference in it. Accordingly,we do not need to ask the question, still less to think that frettingover such a question is philosophy, or even that it is a questionphilosophy cannot answer, the question, viz. ‘How, from thispure essence, how does difference or otherness issue forth fromit?’ For the division into two moments has already taken place,difference is excluded from the self-identical and set apart fromit. What was supposed to be the sel f-identical is thus already oneof these two moments instead of being the absolute essence.That the self-identical divides itself into two means, therefore,just as well that it supersedes itself as already divided, supersedesitself as an otherness. The unity, of which it is usual to say thatdifference cannot issue from it, is in fact itself one of the twomoments; it is the abstraction of the simplicity or unitary natureover against the difference. But in saying that the unity is anabstraction, that is, is only one of the opposed moments, it isalready implied that it is the dividing of itself; for if the unityis a negative, is opposed to something, then it is eo ipso posited asthat which has an antithesis within it. The different moments FORCE AND THE UNDERSTANDING 101 of self-sundering and of becoming sel f-identical are therefore likewiseonly this movement of self-supersession; for since the self-identi-cal, which is supposed first to sunder itself or become its oppo-site, is an abstraction or is already itself a sundered moment, itsself-sundering is therefore a supersession of what it is, and there-fore the supersession of its dividedness.

The Understanding’s‘explanation’ is primarily only the description of what self-con-sciousness is. It supersedes the differences present in the law,differences which have already become pure differences but arestill indifferent, and posits them in a single unity, in Force.

But this movement, or necessity, isthus still a necessity and a movement of the Understanding,or, the movement as such is not the Understanding’s object; onthe contrary, in this movement the Understanding has asobjects positive and negative electricity, distance, force ofattraction, and a thousand other things which constitute thecontent of the moments of the movement.

The necessary advance from the previous shapes ofconsciousness for which their truth was a Thing, an ‘other’ thanthemselves, expresses just this, that not only is consciousness ofa thing possible only for a self-consciousness, but that self-con-sciousness alone is the truth of those shapes.

Raisedabove perception, consciousness exhibits itself closed in a unitywith the supersensible world through the mediating term ofappearance, through which it gazes into this background [lyingbehind appearance].

Thiscurtain [ofappearance] hanging before the inner world is there-fore drawn away, and we have the inner being [the ‘I’] gazinginto the inner world—the vision of the undifferentiated selfsamebeing, which repels itself from itself, posits itself as an innerbeing containing different moments, but for which equallythese moments are immediately not different—self-consctousness.It is manifest that behind the so-called curtain which is sup-posed to conceal the inner world, there is nothing to be seenunless we go behind it ourselves, as much in order that we maysee, as that there may be something behind there which can beseen. But at the same time it is evident that we cannot withoutmore ado go straightway behind appearance.

TheNotion of the object is superseded in the actual object, or thefirst, immediate presentation of the object is superseded in ex-perience: certainty gives place to truth. But now there hasarisen what did not emerge in these previous relationships, viz.a certainty which is identical with its truth; for the certaintyis to itself its own object, and consciousness is to itself the truth.In this there is indeed an otherness; that is to say, consciousnessmakes a distinction, but one which at the same time is for con-sciousness not a distinction. If we give the name of Notion to themovement of knowing, and the name of object to knowing asa passive unity, or as the ‘I’, then we see that not only for us,but for knowing itself, the object corresponds to the Notion.Or alternatively, if we call Notion what the object is m itself,but call the object what 7¢ is qua object or for an other, then itis clear that being-in-itselfand being-for-an-other are one and thesame.

Thus it seems thatonly the principal moment itself has been lost, viz. the simpleself-subsistent existence for consciousness. But in point of fact self-consciousness is the reflection out of the being of the world ofsense and perception, and is essentially the return from otherness.As self-consciousness, it is movement; but since what it distin-guishes from itselfis only itself as itself, the difference, as an other-ness, is immediately superseded for it; the difference is not, and it[self-consciousness] is only the motionless tautology of: ‘I amI’; but since for it the difference does not have the form of being,it is not self-consciousness. Hence otherness is for it in the formof a being, or as a distinct moment; but there is also for conscious-ness the unity of itself with this difference as a second distinctmoment. With that first moment, self-consciousness is in the formof consciousness, and the whole expanse of the sensuous worldis preserved for it, but at the same time only as connected withthe second moment, the unity of self-consciousness with itself;and hence the sensuous world is for it an enduring existencewhich, however, is only appearance, or a difference which, initself, is no difference. This antithesis of its appearance and itstruth has, however, for its essence only the truth, viz. the unityof self-consciousness with itself; this unity must become essentialto self-consciousness, i.e. self-consciousness is Desire in general.Consciousness, as self-consciousness, henceforth has a doubleobject: one is the immediate object, that of sense-certainty andperception, which however for self-consciousness has the characterof a negative; and the second, viz. itself, which is the true essence,and is present in the first instance only as opposed to the firstobject. In this sphere, self-consciousness exhibits itself as themovement in which this antithesis is removed, and the identityof itself with itself becomes explicit for it. 106 B. SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS _ 168. But for us, or in itself, the object which for self-conscious-ness is the negative element has, on its side, returned into itself,just as on the other side consciousness has done.

What self-con-sciousness distinguishes from itself as having being, also has init, in so far as it is posited as being, not merely the characterofsense-certainty and perception, but it is being that is reflectedinto itself, and the object of immediate desire is a living thing.For the in-itself, or the universal result of the relation of theUnderstanding to the inwardness of things, is the distinguishingof what is not to be distinguished, or the unity of what is distin-guished. But this unity is, as we have seen, just as much its repul-sion from itself; and this Notion sunders itself into the antithesisof self-consciousness and life: the former is the unity for whichthe infinite unity of the differences is; the latter, however, isonly this unity itself, so that it is not at the same time for itself,To the extent, then, that consciousness is independent, so too isits object, but only implicitly.

The simple universal fluid mediumis the in-ztself, and the difference of the shapes is the other. Butthis fluid medium itself becomes the other through this dif-ference; for now it is for the difference which exists in and for itself,and consequently is the ceaseless movement by which this pass-ive medium is consumed: Life as a living thing. This inversion, however, is for that reason again an inverted- 108 B. SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS ness in its own self. What is consumedis the essence: the individu-ality which maintains itself at the expense of the universal, andwhich gives itself the feeling of its unity with itself, just by sodoing supersedes its antithesis to the other by means of whichitexists for itself. Its self-given unity with itself is just that fluidityof the differences or their general dissolution. But, conversely, thesupersession of individual existence is equally the productionof it. For since the essence of the individual shape—universalLife—and what exists for itself is in itselfsimple substance, whenthis substance places the other within itself it supersedes this itssimplicity or its essence, i.e. it divides it, and this dividednessof the differenceless fluid medium is just what establishes indivi-duality. Thus the simple substance of Life is the splitting-upofitselfinto shapes and at the same time the dissolution of theseexistent differences; and the dissolution of the splitting-up isjust as much a splitting-up and a forming of members. Withthis, the two sides of the whole movement which before weredistinguished, viz. the passive separatedness of the shapes in thegeneral medium of independence, and the process of Life, col-lapse into one another. The latter is just as much an impartingof shape as a supersession of it; and the other, the impartingofshape, isjustas mucha supersession as an articulation ofshape.The fluid element is itself only the abstraction of essence, or it isactual only as shape; and its articulation of itself is again a split-ting-up of what is articulated into form or a dissolution of it.It is the whole round of this activity that constitutes Life: notwhat wasexpressed at the outset, the immediate continuity andcompactness of its essence, nor the enduring form, the discretemoment existing for itself; nor the pure process of these; noryet the simple taking-together of these moments.

But this objectivenegative moment is none other than the alien being before whichit has trembled. Now, however, he destroys this alien negativemoment, posits himself as a negative in the permanent orderof things, and thereby becomes for himself, someone existing onhis own account. In the lord, the being-for-self is an ‘other’ forthe bondsman, or is only for him [i.e. is not his own]; in fear,the being-for-selfis present in the bondsman himself; in fashion-ing the thing, he becomes aware that being-for-self belongs tohim, that he himself exists essentially and actually in his ownright. The shape does not become something other than himselfthrough being made external to him; for it is precisely this shapethat is his pure being-for-self, which in this externality is seenby him to be the truth. Through this rediscovery of himself by FREEDOM OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS 119 himself, the bondsman realizes that it is precisely in his workwherein he seemed to have only an alienated existence that heacquires a mind ofhis own. For this reflection, the two momentsof fear and service as such, as also that of formative activity,are necessary, both being at the same time in a universal mode.Without the discipline of service and obedience, fear remainsat the formal stage, and does not extend to the known real worldof existence. Without the formative activity, fear remains in-ward and mute, and consciousness does not become explicitlyJor itself. If consciousness fashions the thing without that initialabsolute fear, it is only an empty self-centred attitude; for itsform or negativity is not negativity per se, and therefore itsformative activity cannot give it a consciousness of itself asessential being. Ifit has not experienced absolute fear but onlysome lesser dread, the negative being has remained for it some-thing external, its substance has not been infected by it throughand through. Since the entire contents of its natural conscious-ness have not been jeopardized, determinate being still in prin-ciple attaches to it; having a ‘mind of one’s own’ is self-will, afreedom which is still enmeshed in servitude.

On the contrary, consciousness itself is the abso-lute dialectical unrest, this medley of sensuous and intellectualrepresentations whose differences coincide, and whose identityis equally again dissolved, for it is itself determinateness as con-trasted with the non-identical. But it is just in this process thatthis consciousness, instead of being self-identical, is in fact noth- FREEDOM OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS 125 ing but a purely casual, confused medley, the dizziness of a per-petually self-engendered disorder. It is itself aware of this; foritself maintains and creates this restless confusion. Hence it alsoadmits to it, it owns to being a wholly contingent, single, andseparate consciousness—a consciousness which is empirical,which takes its guidance from what has no reality for it, whichobeys what is for it not an essential being, which does those thingsand brings to realization what it knows has no truth for it. Butequally, while it takes itselfin this way to be a single and separ-ate, contingent and, in fact, animal life, and a lost self-con-sciousness, it also, on the contrary, converts itself again into aconsciousness that is universal and self-identical; for it is thenegativity of all singularity and all difference. From this self-identity, or within its own self, it falls back again into the formercontingency and confusion, for this same spontaneous nega-tivity has to do solely with what is single and separate, andoccupies itself with what is contingent. This consciousness istherefore the unconscious, thoughtless rambling which passesback and forth from the one extreme of self-identical self-con-sciousness to the other extreme of the contingent consciousnessthat is both bewildered and bewildering. It does not itself bringthese two thoughts of itself together. At one time it recognizesthat its freedom lies in rising above all the confusion and contin-gency of existence, and at another time equally admits to arelapse into occupying itself with what is unessential. It lets theunessential content in its thinking vanish; but just in doing soit is the consciousness of something unessential. It pronouncesan absolute vanishing, but the pronouncement ts, and this con-sciousness is the vanishing that is pronounced. It affirms thenullity of seeing, hearing, etc., yet it is itself seeing, hearing,etc. It affirms the nullity of ethical principles, and lets its con-duct be governed by these very principles. Its deeds and itswords always belie one another and equally it has itself thedoubly contradictory consciousness of unchangeableness andsameness, and of utter contingency and non-identity with itself.But it keeps the poles of this its self-contradiction apart, andadopts the same attitude to it as it does in its purely negativeactivity in general.

Its thinking as such is no more than the chaotic jinglingof bells, or a mist of warm incense, a musical thinking that doesnot get as far as the Notion, which would be the sole, immanentobjective mode of thought. This infinite, pure inner feeling doesindeed come into possession of its object; but this does not makeits appearance in conceptual form, not as something [specula-tively] comprehended, and appears therefore as somethingalien. What we have here, then, is the inward movement ofthe pure heart which feels itself, but itself as agonizingly self-divided, the movement of an infinite yearning which is certainthat its essence is such a pure heart, a pure thinking which thinksof itself as a particular individuality, certain of being known andrecognized by this object, precisely because the latter thinks ofitself as an individuality.

It has already flown; for itisin part the Unchangeable which thinks ofitselfas an individu-ality, and consciousness therefore directly attains in it its ownself—its own self, but as the antithesis of the Unchangeable; in-stead of laying hold of the essence, it only feeds it and has fallenback into itself. Since, in attaining itself, consciousness is unableto get away from itselfas this antithesis to the Unchangeable, ithas, insteadoflayinghold of the essence, only laid hold of what isunessential. Just as, on the one hand, when striving to find itselfin the essence it takes hold only of its own separate existence,so on the other hand it cannot lay hold of the ‘other’ as an indivi-dual or as an actual Being. Where that ‘other’ is sought, it cannotbe found, for it is supposed to be just a beyond, something thatcan not be found. When sought as a particular individual, itis not a universal individuality in the form of thought, not a 132 B. SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS Notion, but an individual in the form ofan object, or an actualindividual; an object of immediate sense-certainty, and for thatvery reason only something that has already vanished. Con-sciousness, therefore, can only find as a present reality the graveof its life. But because this grave is itself an actual existence andit is contrary to the nature of what actually exists to afford alasting possession, the presence of that grave, too, is merely thestruggle of an enterprise doomed to failure. But having learnedfrom experience that the grave of its actual unchangeable Beinghas no actuality, that the vanished individuality, because it hasvanished, is not the true individuality, consciousness will aban-don its quest for the unchangeable individuality as an actualexistence, or will stop trying to hold on to what has vanished.Only then is it capable of finding individuality in its genuineor universal form."},{"number":218,"text":"But, in the first instance, the return of the feeling heart intoitself is to be taken to mean that it has an actual existence asan individual.

Thus it comes forward here as self-feel-ing, or as an actual consciousness existing on its own account.In this return into self there comes to view its second relation-ship, that of desire and work in which consciousness finds con-firmation of that inner certainty of itself which we know it hasattained, by overcoming and enjoying the existence alien to it,viz. existence in the form of independent things. But the Un-happy Consciousness merely finds itself desiring and working; itis not aware that to find itself active in this way implies thatit is in fact certain of itself, and that its feeling of the alien exist-ence is this self-feeling. Since it is not explicitly aware of thiscertainty, its inner life really remains a still incomplete self-cer-tainty ; that confirmation which it would receive through workand enjoyment is therefore equally incomplete ; in other words,it must itself set at nought this confirmation so that it may in-deed find in it confirmation, but only confirmation of what itis for itself, viz. of its dividedness."},{"number":219,"text":"The world of actuality to which desire and work aredirected is no longer for this consciousness something intrinsically FREEDOM OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS 133 null, something merely to be set aside and consumed, but some-thing like that consciousness itself, an actuality broken in two,which is only from one aspect intrinsically null, but fromanother aspect is also a sanctified world; it is the form of theUnchangeable, for this has retained individuality, and because,as the Unchangeable, it is a Universal, its individuality has ingeneral the significance ofall actuality."},{"number":220,"text":"If consciousness were aware of being an independentconsciousness, and the world of actuality were for it an absolutenullity, then in work and enjoyment it would attain to a feelingofits independence, since the world of actuality would be nulli-fied by itself.

Onthe contrary, since it does succeed in setting it at nought andenjoying it, this comes about through the Unchangeable’s itselfhaving surrendered its embodied form, and having relinquished itfor the enjoyment of consciousness.

That relation to actuality is the changing of it or workingon it, the betng-for-self which belongs to the individual conscious-ness as such.

It is, therefore, only a superficial element from each sidethat is involved in the moving interplay of their mutual opposi-tion. The [passive] extreme of actuality is set aside by the activeextreme; but the actuality, on its side, can only be set asidebecause its own unchangeable essence sets it aside, repels itselffrom itself, and hands over what is repelled to the activeextreme. The active force appears as the power in which actu- 134 B.

Instead, therefore, of returning from its activity back intoitself, and having obtained confirmation of its self-certainty,consciousness really reflects this activity back into the otherextreme, which is thus exhibited as a pure universal, as the abso-lute power from which the activity started in all directions, andwhich is the essence both of the self-dividing extremes as theyat first appeared, and of their interchanging relationship itself."},{"number":222,"text":"The fact that the unchangeable consciousness renouncesand surrenders its embodied form, while, on the other hand, theparticular individual consciousness gives thanks [for the gift], i.e.denies itself the satisfaction of being conscious of its independence,and assigns the essence of its action not to itself but to thebeyond, through these two moments of reciprocal self-surrenderof both parts, consciousness does, of course, gain a sense of itsunity with the Unchangeable. But this unity is at the same timeaffected with division, is again broken within itself, and fromit there emerges once more the antithesis of the universal andthe individual. For though consciousness renounces the show ofsatisfying its feeling of self, it obtains the actual satisfaction ofit; for it has been desire, work, and enjoyment; as consciousnessit has welled, acted, and enjoyed. Similarly, even its giving of thanks,in which it acknowledges the other extreme as the essentialBeing and counts itself nothing, is its own act which counter-balances the action of the other extreme, and meets the self-sacrificing beneficence with a like action. If the other extremedelivers over to consciousness only the surface of its being, yetconsciousness also gives thanks; and in surrendering its ownaction, i.e. its essential being, it really does more than the otherwhich only sheds a superficial element of itself. Thus the entiremovement is reflected not only in the actual desiring, working,and enjoyment, but even in the very giving of thanks wherethe reverse seems to take place, in the extreme of individuality.Consciousness feels itself therein as this particular individual,and does not let itself be deceived by its own seeming renuncia-tion, for the truth ofthe matter is that it has not renounced itself.What has been brought about is only the double reflection intothe two extremes; and the result is the renewed division into FREEDOM OF SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS 135 the opposed consciousness of the Unchangeable, and the con-sciousness of willing, performing, and enjoying, and self-renunciation itself which confronts it; in other words, the con-sciousness of independent individuality in general."},{"number":223,"text":"With this appears the third relationship of the processof this consciousness, which proceeds from the second as a con-sciousness that has truly proved itself to be independent, by itswill and its deed.

It has the certainty of having trulydivested itself of its ‘J’, and of having turned its immediate self-consciousness into a Thing, into an objective existence. Onlythrough this actual sacrifice could it demonstrate this self-renunciation.

SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS that sacrifice made by the unessential extreme was at the sametime not a one-sided action, but contained within itself theaction of the other. For the surrender of one’s own will is onlyfrom one aspect negative; in principle, however, or in itself,it is at the same time positive, viz. the positing of will as thewill of an ‘other’, and specifically of will, not as a particular,but as a universal will. This positive meaning of the negativelyposited particular will is taken by this consciousness to be thewill of the other extreme, the will which, precisely because itis an ‘other’ for consciousness, becomes actual for it, not throughthe Unhappy Consciousness itself, but through a Third, themediator as counsellor. Hence, for consciousness, its will doesindeed become universal and essential will, but consciousnessitself does not take itself to be this essential will. The surrenderof its own will, as a particular will, is not taken by it to be inprinciple the positive aspect of universal will. Similarly, its giv-ing up of possessions and enjoyment has only the same negativemeaning, and the universal which thereby comes to be for it,is not regarded as its own doing.

But for itself, action and its own actualdoing remain pitiable, its enjoyment remains pain, and theovercoming of these in a positive sense remains a beyond.

In this movement it has also become awareof its unity with this universal, a unity which, for us, no longerfalls outside of-it since the superseded single individual is theuniversal, and which, since consciousness maintains itself in thisits negativity, is present in consciousness as such as its essence.Its truth is that which appears in the syllogism whose extremesappeared as held absolutely asunder, as the middle term whichproclaims to the unchangeable consciousness that the single in-dividual has renounced itself, and, to the individual, that theUnchangeable is for it no longer an extreme, but is reconciledwith it.

Just as conscious-ness, that comes on the scene as Reason, possesses that certaintydirectly in itself, so too does idealism give direct expression tothat certainty: ‘I am I’, in the sense that the ‘I’ which is anobject for me is the sole object, is all reality and all that ispresent. Here, the ‘I’ that is object for me, is not merely anempty object in general, as it is for self-consciousness as such,noris it, asin free self-consciousness, merely an object that with-draws itself from other objects which retain their worth alongsideit; on the contrary, it is for self-consciousness an object suchthat any other object whatever is a non-being. But self-conscious-ness is all reality, not merely for itself but also in itself, only ‘through becoming this reality, or rather through demonstratingitself to be such. It demonstrates itself to be this along the pathin which first, in the dialectic movement of ‘meaning’, perceiv-ing and understanding, otherness as an intrinsic being vanishes.Then, in the movement through the independence of conscious-ness in lordship and bondage, through the conception of free-dom, through the liberation that comes from Scepticism andthe struggle for absolute liberation by the consciousness dividedagainst itself, otherness, in so far as it is only for consciousness,vanishes for consciousness itself. There appeared two aspects, oneafter the other: one in which the essence or the True had forconsciousness the determinateness of being, the other in whichit had the determinateness of being only for consciousness. Butthe two reduced themselves to a single truth, viz. that what is, CERTAINTY AND TRUTH OF REASON 141 or the in-itself, only zs in so far as it is for consciousness, andwhat is for consciousness is also in itself or has intrinsic being.The consciousness which is this truth has this path behind itand has forgotten it, and comes on the scenc immediately asReason; in other words, this Reason which comes immediatelyon the scene appears only as the certainty of that truth. Thusit merely asserts that it is all reality, but does not itself com-prehend this; for it is along that forgotten path that thisimmediately expressed assertion is comprehended. Andequally, anyone who has not trodden this path finds this asser-tion incomprehensible when he hears it in this pure form—although he does as a matter of fact make the assertion him-self in a concrete shape [i.e. the assertion is implicit in hisbehaviour]. . 234. The idealism that does not demonstrate that path butstarts off with this assertion is therefore, too, a pure assertionwhich does not comprehend its own self, nor can it make itselfcomprehensible to others. It proclaims an immediate certaintywhich is confronted by other immediate certainties, whichhave, however, been lost on that same path. With equal right,therefore, the assertions of these other certainties, too, take theirplace alongside the assertion of that certainty. Reason appealsto the se/f-consciousness of each and every consciousness: ‘J amI, my object and my essence is J’; and no one will deny Reasonthis truth. But in basing itself on this appeal, Reason sanctionsthe truth of the other certainty, viz. that there is for me an‘other’; that an other than ‘I’ is object and essence for me, or,in that I am object and essence to myself, I am only so by draw-ing back from the ‘other’ altogether, and taking my place asan actuality alongside it. Not until Reason comes on the sceneas a reflection from this opposite certainty does its affirmationabout itself present itself not merely as a certainty and an asser-tion, but as truth; and not merely alongside other truths butas the sole truth. Its immediate appearance on the scene is theabstraction of its actual presence, the essence and the in-itself ofwhich is the absolute Notion, i.e. the movement which has broughtit into being. Consciousness will determine its relationship tootherness or its object in various ways, according to the precisestage it has reached in the development of the World-Spirit intoself-consciousness.

But now this category or simple unityof self-consciousness and being possesses difference in itself; forits essence is just this, to be immediately one and selfsame inotherness, or in absolute difference. The difference therefore is,but is perfectly transparent, and a difference that is at the sametime none. It appears as a plurality of categories. Since idealismproclaims the simple unity of self-consciousness to be all reality,and immediately makes it the essence without having grasped itas the absolutely negative essence---only this has negation,determinateness, or difference within it—this second assertionis even more incomprehensible than the first, viz. that in thecategory there are differences or species of categories.

It is bound, therefore, to be at the sametime absolute empiricism, for in order to give filling to theempty ‘mine’, i.e. to get hold of difference with all its developedformations, its Reason requires an extraneous impulse, in whichfirst is to be found the multiplicity of sensations and ideas.

This superficial raising 148 C. (AA.) REASON out of singularity, and the equally superficial form of uni-versality into which the sensuous object is merely taken up,without becoming in its own self a universal, this activity ofdescribing things, is not as yet a movement in the object itself;the movement is really only in the describing of the object. Theobject, as described, has lost its interest; when one has beendescribed, then another must be started on, and continuallylooked for, in order that the activity of describing shall not cometo an end.

Through this distinction into what is essential andwhat is unessential, the Notion rises above the dispersion of the OBSERVING REASON 149 sensuous, and cognition thus makes it clear that it is just asessentially concerned with its own self as with things. Thisduplication of what is essential gives rise to hesitation on thepart of cognition as to whether what is essential and necessaryfor cognition is so also in respect of things. On the one hand,the differentiae enable cognition to distinguish one thing fromanother; but, on the other hand, it is not the unessential aspectof things that has to be known, but that characteristic wherebythe things themselves break loose from the general continuity ofbeing as such, separate themselves from others, and are explicitlyfor themselves. Differentiae are supposed, not merely to have anessential connection with cognition, but also to accord with theessential characteristics of things, and our artificial system issupposed to accord with Nature’s own system and to expressonly this. This follows necessarily from the Notion of Reason;and the instinct of Reason—for, in this observational activity,Reason operates only instinctively—has also in its systemsachieved this unity, viz. its objects are themselves so constitutedthat they contain in themselves an essentiality or a being-for-self, and are not merely the accident of a particular momentora particular place. The distinguishing marks of animals, e.g.,are taken from their claws and teeth; for in point of fact it isnot only cognition that thereby distinguishes one animal fromanother, but each animal itself separates itself from othersthereby; by means of these weapons it maintains itself in itsindependence and in its detachment from the generality. Theplant, on the other hand, does not attain to a being-for-self butmerely touches the boundary-line of individuality. It is at thisboundary, therefore, where there is a show of division into sexes,that plants have been studied and distinguished from oneanother. What, however, stands on a still lower level cannotitself any longer distinguish itself from another, but in beingcontrasted with it gets lost. Being that is at rest, and being thatis in a relation, come into conflict with each other; a Thingin the latter case is something different from what it is in theformer state, whereas the single individual maintains itself inits relation to something else. What, however, is unable to dothis and, qua chemical object, becomes something else than it isempirically, confuses cognition, and gives rise to the same con-flicting views as to whether it ought to keep to one side or the 150 C.

If, now, on the one side, the determinatenessgains the ascendancy over the universal in which it has itsessence, on the other side again, this universal equally main-tains its control over that determinateness, pushes it to its boun-dary and there mixes up its distinctions and essentialities.Observation, which kept them properly apart and believed thatin them it had something firm and settled, sees principles over-lapping one another, transitions and confusions developing;what it at first took to be absolutely separate, it sees combinedwith something else, and what it reckoned to be in combination,it sees apart and separate. So it is that observation which clingsto passive, unbroken selfsameness of being, inevitably sees itselftormented just in its most general determinations—e.g. of whatare the differentiae of an animal or a plant—by instances whichrob it of every determination, invalidate the universality towhich it had risen, and reduce it to an observation and descrip-tion which is devoid of thought."},{"number":248,"text":"Observation which confines itself in this way to whatis simple, or restrains the scattered sensuous elements by theuniversal, thus finds in its object the confusion of its principle,because what is determinate must, through its own nature, loseitself in its opposite.

Since Reason nowreaches the stage of looking for the determinateness as some- OBSERVING REASON 151 thing which essentially is not for itself, but which passes overinto its opposite, it seeks for the law and the Notion of the deter-minateness. True, it seeks for them equally as an actuality inthe form of immediate being, but this will, in fact, vanish for it,and the aspects of the law become pure moments or abstrac-tions, so that the law comes to light in the nature of the Notion,which has destroyed within itself the indifferent subsistence ofsensuous reality."},{"number":249,"text":"To the observing consciousness, the truth of the law isfound in experience, in the same way that sensuous being is [anobject] for consciousness; is not in and for itself.

In other words, the Notion displays itself in the formof thinghood and sensuous being; but it does not on thataccount lose its nature, nor relapse into an inert subsistence oran indifferent succession. What is universally valid is also uni-versally effective; what ought to be, in fact also is, and whatonly ought to be without [actually] being, has no truth. Theinstinct of Reason, for its part, rightly holds firmly to this stand-point, and refuses to be led astray by figments of thought whichonly ought to be and, as ‘oughts’, are credited with truth,although they are nowhere met with in experience; or by hypo-theses as little as by all the other invisible entities of a perennial‘ought’.

But it contradicts its own beliefin the fact 152 C. (AA.) REASON that it does not itself take its universality to mean that every singlesensuous thing must have provided evidence of the law, in orderto enable the truth of the law to be asserted. The assertion thatstones fall when raised above the ground and dropped certainlydoes not require us to make this experiment with every stone;it does perhaps mean that the experiment must have been madewith at least a great number, and from this we can then by anal-ogy draw an inference about the rest with the greatest prob-ability or with perfect right. But analogy not only does not givea perfect right, but on account of its nature contradicts itselfso often that the inference to be drawn from analogy itself israther that analogy does not permit an inference to be made.Probability, which is what the result would amount to, loses, inface of truth, every distinction of lesser and greater probability;let it be as great as it may, it is nothing as against truth. Butthe instinct of Reason does in fact take such laws for truth, andit is when it does not discern necessity in them that it comesto make this distinction, and reduces the truth of the matteritself to the level of probability, in order to indicate the imper-fect way in which truth presents itself to the consciousness whichhas not yet attained to insight into the pure Notion; for uni-versality is present only as a simple immediate universality. But,at the same time, on account of this universality, the law hastruth for consciousness. T hat a stone falls, is true for conscious-ness because in its heaviness the stone has in and for itselfthat essential relation to the earth which is expressed infalling. Consciousness thus has in experience the being of thelaw, but it has, too, the law in the form of a Notion; and it isonly because of the two aspects together that the law is truefor consciousness.

The law as it first appearsexhibits itself in an impure form, enveloped in single, sensuousforms of being, and the Notion constituting its nature isimmersed in empirical material. In its experiments the instinct OBSERVING REASON 153 of Reason sets out to find what happens in such and such cir-cumstances. The result is that the law seems only to be all themore immersed in sensuous being. The inner significance of thisinvestigation is to find the pure conditions of the law; and thismeans nothing else (even if the consciousness expressing itsmeaning in this way were to think it meant something different)than to raise the law into the form of Notion, and to free itsmoments completely from being tied to a specific being. Forexample, negative electricity, which at first comes to be known,say, as resin-electricity, and positive electricity as glass-elec-tricity, these, as a result of experiments, lose altogether sucha significance and become purely positive and negative elec-tricity, neither of which is any longer attached to a particularkind of thing; and we can no longer say that there are bodieswhich are positively electrical and others which are negativelyelectrical. In the same way, the relationship of acid and baseand their reaction constitute a law in which these opposite sidesappear as bodies. But these separated detached things have noactuality; the power which forces them apart cannot preventthem from at once entering again into a process, for they areonly this relation. They cannot, like a tooth or a claw, remainapart on their own and as such be pointed out. This essentialnature of theirs, to pass over immediately into a neutral pro-duct, makes their being into a being which is implicitly super-seded or universal; and acid and base have truth only as uni-versals. Therefore, just as glass and resin can just as well be posi-tively as negatively electrical, in the same way acid and baseare not tied as properties to this or that actuality; each thingis only relatively acid or base: what seems to be an absolute baseor acid gets in the so-called synsomaties! the opposite signifi-cance in relation to something else.—The result of the experi-ments is in this way to cancel the moments or activated sidesas properties of specific things, and to free the predicates fromtheir subjects. These predicates are found only as universals,as in truth they are; because of this self-subsistence they getthe name of ‘matters’, which are neither bodies nor properties; 1A term coined by a chemist, Winter], at the beginning of the nineteenth century.These synsomaties are combinations formed directly without any intermediary which would produce and itself undergo change; they are still, in consequence, not strictlychemical processes. 154 C.

This which is in truth the resultand essence [of its activity], is now present to this consciousnessitself, but as an object; further, since for it the object is not aresult, and is not connected with the preceding activity, itpresents itself to consciousness as a particular kind of object, andthe relation of consciousness to it appears as another kind ofobservation."},{"number":254,"text":"Such an object, in which the process is present in thesimplicity of the Notion, is the organism.

None of them shows itself as essential, asfree to enter into relation with an other, and consequently whatis organic maintains itself in its relation."},{"number":255,"text":"The aspects of law which the instinct of Reason here pro-ceeds to observe are, as follows from the above characterization,in the first instance, organic Nature and inorganic Nature in theirrelation to one another. The latter is, for organic Nature, no OBSERVING REASON 155 more than the freedom—a freedom opposed to the simple Notionof organic Nature—of the loosely connected determinatenesses inwhich the individual forms of Nature are dissolved and which,at the same time, breaking away from their continuity, existon their own account. Air, water, earth, zones, and climate areuniversal elements of this sort, which constitute the indetermi-nate simple essence of [natural] individualities, and in whichthese are at the same time reflected into themselves. Neitherthe individuality, nor the universal element, isabsolutely in andfor itself; on the contrary, though they appear to observationas free and independent, they behave at the same time as essenti-ally connected, but in such a way that their independence andmutual indifference are the predominant feature, and only inpart become abstractions. Here, then, we have law as the con-nection of a [universal] element with the formative process ofthe organism which, on the one hand, has the elementary beingover against it, and, on the other hand, exhibits it within itsorganic reflection. But laws of this kind: animals belonging tothe air have the nature of birds, those belonging to water havethe nature of fish, animals in northern latitudes have thick,hairy pelts, and so on—such laws are seen at a glance to displaya poverty which does not do justice to the manifold variety oforganic Nature. Besides the fact that organic Nature in its free-dom can divest its forms of these characteristics, and of necessityeverywhere presents exceptions to such laws, or rules as wemight call them, the characterization of the creatures to whichthey do apply is so superficial that even the necessity of the lawscannot be other than superficial, and amounts to no more thanthe great influence of environment; and this does not tell us whatdoes and what does not strictly belong to this influence. Suchrelations of organisms to the elements [they live in] cannottherefore in fact be called laws. For, firstly, the content of sucha relation, as we saw, does not exhaust the range of the organ-isms concerned, and secondly, the sides of the relation itself aremutually indifferent, and express no necessity. In the Notionof acid lies the Notion of base, just as the Notion of positive elec-tricity implies that of negative; but often as we may find a thick,hairy pelt associated with northern latitudes, or the structureof a fish associated with water, or that of birds with air, theNotion of north does not imply the Notion ofa thick, hairy pelt, 156 C. (AA.) REASON the Notion of sea does not imply the Notion of the structureoffish, or the Notion ofair that of the structure of birds. Becauseof the freedom of the two sides in relation to each other, thereare also land animals which have the essential characteristicsof a bird, of a fish, and so on. The necessity, just because itcannot be grasped as an inner necessity of the creature, ceasesto have a sensuous existence, and can no longer be observedin the world of reality, but has withdrawn from it. Finding thusno place in the actual creature, itis what is called a teleologicalrelation, a relation which is external to the related terms, andtherefore really the antithesis of a law. Itis a conception com-pletely freed from the necessity of Nature, a conception whichleaves that necessity behind and operates spontaneously aboveit."},{"number":256,"text":"Ifthe relation, referred to above, ofthe organism to thenatural elements does not express its essence, the notion of End,on theotherhand, does contain it. It is true that, for the observ-ing consciousness, this Notion is not the organism’s own essence,but something falling outside of it, and is then only the above-mentioned external teleological relation. Yet the organism, as ithas been characterized above, is, in fact, the real End itself;for since it preserves ttself in the relation to an other, it is justthat kind of natural existence in which Nature reflects itself intothe Notion, and the two moments of cause and effect, of activeand passive moments, which were the result of a necessaryseparating-out, are brought together into a unity, so that heresomething does not appear merely as a result of necessity. But,because it has returned into itself, the last, or the result, is justas much the first which initiated the movement, and is to itselfthe realized End. The organism does not produce somethingbut only preserves itself; or, what is produced, is as muchalready present as produced."},{"number":257,"text":"We must examine more closely this determination ofEnd, both as it is in itself, and as it is for the instinct of Reason,in order to see how the latter finds itself therein, but does notrecognize itself in what it finds. The notion of End, then, towhich Reason in its role of observer rises, is a Notion of whichit is aware; but it is also no less present as something actual, andis not an external relation of the latter, but its essence. This actu-ality, which is itself an End, is related purposively to an other: OBSERVING REASON 157 which means that its relation is a contingent one with respectto what both immediately are; immediately, both are independent and mutually indifferent. But the essence of their relationis something different from what they thus appear to be, andtheir action has a different meaning from the one sense-percep-tion at first finds in it. The necessity in what takes place ishidden, and shows itself only in the End, but in such a waythat this very End shows that the necessity has also been therefrom the beginning. The End, however, shows this priority ofitself in the fact that nothing else issues from the alterationresulting from the action than what was already there. Or, ifwe Start from what is first, then this in its End, or in the outcomeof its action, returns only to itself; and through this very factit demonstrates itself to be something that has its own self forits End, and thus, as a prius, has already returned to itself oris in and for itself. Therefore, what it arrives at through the pro-cess of its action is itself; and in arriving only at itself, it obtainsits feeling ofself. We have here, it is true, the distinction betweenwhat it 7s and what it seeks, but this is merely the show of adistinction, and consequently it is in its own self a Notion."},{"number":258,"text":"But thisisjust how self-consciousnessis constituted; it like-wise distinguishes itself from itself without producing any dis-tinction. Hence it finds in the observation of organic Naturenothing else than a being of this kind; it finds itself as a thing,as a life, but makes a distinction between what it is itself andwhat it has found, a distinction, however, which is none. Justas the instinct of the animal seeks and consumes food, butthereby brings forth nothing other than itself, so too the instinctof Reason in its quest finds only Reason itself. The animalfinishes up with the feeling of self. The instinct of Reason, onthe other hand, is at the same time self-consciousness; butbecause it is only instinct itis put on one side over against con-sciousness, in which it has its antithesis. Its satisfaction is, there-fore, shattered by this antithesis; it does indeed find itself, viz.the End, and likewise this End as a Thing. But firstly, the Endis for that instinct outside of the thing presenting itself as End.Secondly, this End, gua End, is also objective, and therefore doesnot fall within the observing consciousness itself, but in anotherintelligence."},{"number":259,"text":"Examined more closely, this determination of End lies 158 C. (AA.) REASON just as much in the Notion of the thing, that of being in its ownself an End. That is to say, it preserves itself; i.e. it is at oneand the same time its nature to conceal the necessity, and toexhibit it in the form of a contingent relation. For its freedomor its being-for-self is just this, to treat the necessity [of the rela-tion] as of no importance. Thus it presents itself as somethingwhose Notion falls outside of its being. Similarly, Reason hasof necessity to look on its own Notion as falling outside of it,hence as a Thing, as something towards which it is indifferentand which is therefore reciprocally indifferent towards Reasonand its Notion. As instinct, Reason also remains at the levelof [mere] being and a state of indifference, and the Thing express-ing the Notion remains for it something other than this Notion,and the Notion other than the Thing. Thus, for Reason, theorganic thing is in its own self an End only in the sense thatthe necessity which presents itself as hidden in the action of thething—for this behaves as an indifferent being-for-self—fallsoutside of the organism itself. Since, however, the organism asan End in its own self cannot behave in any other way thanas an organism, the fact that it is an End in itselfis also manifestand present in sensuous fashion, and it is as such that it isobserved. The organism shows itself to be a being that preservesitself, that returns and has returned into itself. But this observingconsciousness does not recognize in this being the Notion ofEnd, or that the Notion of End exists just here and in the formof a Thing, and not elsewhere in some other intelligence. Itmakes a distinction between the Notion of End and being-for-self and self-preservation, a distinction which is none. That itis in fact no distinction is something of which this consciousnessis not aware; on the contrary, the making of the distinctionappears to it as a contingent act having no essential connectionwith what is brought about by that act; and the unity whichlinks the two together, viz. the said act and the End, fallsasunder for this consciousness."},{"number":260,"text":"On this view, what belongs to the organism itself is theaction lying in the middle between its first and last stage, sofar as this action bears within it the character of singleness.

That single action which is only a means comes throughits singleness under the category of an altogether single or con-tingent necessity. What an organism does to preserve itself asan individual or as a genus is, therefore, as regards this imme-diate content, quite uncontrolled by any law, for the universaland the Notion fall outside of it. Accordingly, its activity wouldbe an empty activity devoid of any content of its own; it wouldnot be even the activity of a machine, for this has a purpose,and its activity therefore a specific content. Deserted in this wayby the universal, it would be the activity merely of somethingimmediate qua immediate, i.e. an activity like that of an acid orbase which is not at the same time reflected into itself; anactivity which could not separate itself from its immediate exist-ence, nor give up this existence (which gets lost in the relationto its opposite), and still preserve itself. But the thing whoseactivity is under consideration here is posited as a thing thatpreserves itself in its relation to its opposite. The activity as suchis nothing but the pure essenceless form of its being-for-self, andits substance, which is not merely a determinate being but theuniversal, or its End, does not fall outside of it. It is an activitywhich spontaneously returns into itself, and is not turned backinto itself by anything alien to it."},{"number":261,"text":"However, this unity ofuniversality and the activity doesnot exist for this observing consciousness, because that unity isessentially the inner movement of the organism and can onlybe grasped as Notion; but observation seeks the moments inthe form of being, of enduring being; and because the natureof what is organically a whole is such that the moments arenot contained in it nor can be found in it in that form, conscious-ness converts the antithesis into one that conforms to its pointof view."},{"number":262,"text":"In this way, the organism appears to the observing con-sciousness as a relation of two fixed moments in the form of imme-diate being---of an antithesis whose two sides, on the one hand,appear to be given to it in observation, and on the other hand,as regards their content, express the antithesis of the organicNotion of End and actuality; but because the Notion as suchis effaced therein, the antithesis is expressed in an obscure andsuperficial way, in which thought has sunk to the level ofpicture-thinking.

On the contrary, the organic being in itsabsolute undividedness is made the foundation, as the contentof inner and outer, and is the same for both. Consequently, theantithesis is still only a purely formal one, whose real sides havethe same in-itselffor their essence; but, at the same time, sinceinner and outer are opposite realities, and each is a distinctbeing for observation, they each seem to observation to havea peculiar content of their own. However, this peculiar content,since it is the same substance or organic unity, can in fact onlybe a different form of that substance, of that unity; and thisis implied by the observing consciousness when it says thatthe outer is merely the expression of the inner.

The law, as the relation of thatinner to this outer, thus expresses its content, once by settingforth universal moments or simple essentialities, and again by set-ting forth the actualized essentiality or shape. Those first simple,organic properties, to call them such, are Sensibility, Irritability,and Reproduction. These properties, at least the first two, seemindeed to refer not to the organism in general, but only to the OBSERVING REASON 161 animal organism.

Reproduction, taken in the sense of self-preservation ingeneral, expresses the formal Notion of the organism, or Sensi-bility; but it is, strictly speaking, the real organic Notion orthe whole, which returns into itself, either qua individual by pro-ducing single parts of itself, or, gua genus, by bringing forth in-dividuals."},{"number":267,"text":"The other significance of these organic elements, viz.as outer, is their particular shape, according to which they arepresent as [outwardly] actual, but at the same time, universalparts, or organic systems: Sensibility, let us say, as a nervoussystem, Irritability as a muscular system, Reproduction as avisceral system, for the preservation of the individual and thespecies."},{"number":268,"text":"The laws peculiar to organisms accordingly concern arelationship of the organic moments in their twofold signifi-cance, once as being a part of the organic structure, and againas being a universal fluid determinateness which pervades allthose systems.

But,in addition, the aspect of the inner is, on its own account, alsoa relationship of several aspects; and we are therefore pre-sented, to begin with, with the conception of a law as an inter-relationship of the universal organic activities or properties.Whether such a law is possible must be decided from the natureof such a property. This, however, as a universal fluid is, onthe one hand, not something restricted like a Thing, keepingitself to the restricted form which is supposed to constitute itsshape: sensibility extends beyond the nervous system and per-meates all the other systems of the organism. On the other hand,such a property is a universal moment, which is essentially notdivorced or separated from reaction or irritability, and repro-duction. For, as reflection-into-self, it eo ipso contains reaction.Mere reflectedness-into-selfis passivity or a dead being, not sen-sibility; just as action—which is the same as reaction—whennot reflected into itself, is not irritability. It is precisely the unityof reflection in action or reaction, and action or reaction in re-flection, that constitutes the organism, a unity which is synony-mous with organic reproduction. It follows from this that, in OBSERVING REASON 163 every mode of the organism’s actuality, there must be presentthe same quantity of sensibility—since to begin with we are con-sidering the relation of sensibility and irritability to oneanother—as of irritability, and that an organic phenomenoncan be apprehended and determined or, if you like, explained,just as much in terms of the one as of the other. What one persontakes, say, for high sensibility, another may equally well takefor high irritability, and irritability of the same degree. If theyare called factors, and this word is not to be meaningless, theyare thereby declared to be moments of the Notion; thus the realobject whose essence is constituted by this Notion, containsthem both equally within it, and if the object is character-ized according to the one moment as very sensitive, it mustalso be stated, according to the other moment, to be just asirritable."},{"number":271,"text":"If they are distinguished, as they necessarily are, thisis in accordance with the Notion, and their opposition is qualita-tive.

Their peculiar qualitative antithesis thusbecomes one of magnitude, and there arise laws of this kind, forexample, that sensibility and irritability stand in an inverseratio of their magnitude, so that as the one increases the otherdecreases; or better, taking directly the magnitude itself as thecontent, as its smallness decreases. Should, however, a specificcontent be given to this law, say, that the size of a hole increases,the more what it is filled with decreases, then this inverse relationcan equally be changed into a direct relation and expressed inthis way, that the size of the hole increases in direct ratio to theamount taken away—a tautological proposition, whetherexpressed as a direct or an inverse ratio. As so expressed, theproposition means simply this, that a quantity increases as thisquantity increases. Just as the hole and what fills it and is takenaway are qualitatively opposed, but what is real in them, andits specific quantity, is one and the same in both, and similarly,increase of magnitude and decrease of smallness are the same,and their meaningless antithesis amounts to a tautology: so arethe organic moments alike indivisible in their real content, andin their magnitude, which is the magnitude of that being; the ‘ 164 C.

Or again, anumber, e.g. three, remains the same quantity whether it is takenpositively or negatively, and if I increase the three to four, thenboth the positive and the negative have become four; just asthe south pole of a magnet is exactly as strong as its north pole,or a positive electricity, or an acid, is exactly as strong as itsnegative, or the base on which it acts. An organic existence isjust such a magnitude as the said ‘three’, or a magnet, etc. Itis that which is increased or diminished, and when it is increasedboth of its factors are increased, just as both poles of the magnetor both kinds of electricity increase if the potential of a magnetor of one of the electric currents is raised. That both can varyjust as little in intension and extension, that the one cannot de-crease in extension but increase in intension, while the other,conversely, is supposed to decrease its intension but increaseitsextension—thisstems from the same notion of an empty anti-thesis; the real intension is absolutely as great as the extension,and vice versa."},{"number":272,"text":"It is evident that what really happens in formulatingthis kind of law is that at the outset irritability and sensibilityconstitute the organic antithesis; but this content gets lost sightof and the antithesis deteriorates into a formal one of quantita-tive increase and decrease, or of varying intension and exten-slion—an antithesis which no longer has anything to do withthe nature ofsensibility and irritability, and no longer expressesit.

But these sensuous properties, hardness,colour, etc., as also the phenomena of response to the stimulusofoats, ofirritable response to loads, or of the number and kindof young produced, when they are related to one another andcompared among themselves, essentially conflict with any con-formity to a law.

Or, again, if the abstractIdea of the organism is truly expressed in those three moments,merely because they are not static and are only moments ofthe Notion and of movement, the organism, on the other hand,asa structured shape, is not exhaustively dealt with in the threespecific systems into which it is analysed by anatomy. In so faras such systems are supposed to be found actually existing, andto be authenticated by being so found, it must also be bornein mind that anatomy presents us not only with three such sys-tems but with agood many more.

In the systems of shape as such, theorganism is apprehended from the abstract aspect of a deadexistence; its moments so taken pertain to anatomy and thecorpse, not to cognition and the living organism. In such parts,the moments have really ceased to be, for they cease to be pro-cesses. Since the being of the organism is essentially a universalityor areflection-into-self, the being of its totality, like its moments,cannot consist in an anatomical system; on the contrary, theactual expression of the whole, and the externalization of itsmoments, are really found only as a movement which runs itscourse through the various parts of the structure, a movementin which what is forcibly detached and fixed as an individualsystem essentially displays itself as a fluid moment.

As regards content, the laws obtained hereought not to be such as are merely a passive taking-up into theform of universality of simply inert differences, but laws whichdirectly possess in these differences the unrest of the Notion,and consequently at the same time possess the necessity of therelation between the aspects. But just because the object, theorganic unity, directly unites the infinite supersession, or abso-lute negation, of being with inert being, and because themoments are essentially a pure transition, there are no such inertaspects as are required for the law."},{"number":280,"text":"In order to obtain such aspects, the Understandingmust keep to the other moment of the organic relationship, viz.to the reflectedness of organic existence into itself.

Immediate sensuousbeing isimmediately one with the determinateness as such, andtherefore expresses a qualitative difference in that being, e.g.blueas against red, acid as against alkali, and soon. But organicbeing that has returned into itself is completely indifferent to-wards an other, its existence is a simple universality, and itdenies to observation any lasting sensuous differences or, whatis the same thing, displays its essential determinateness only asthe flux of inert determinatenesses. Consequently, the way inwhich difference, qua inert, expresses itself is just this, that itis an indifferent difference, i.e. difference as magnitude. In this,however, the Notionis extinguished and necessity has vanished.But then the content and filling of this indifferent being, theflux of sensuous determinations gathered up into an organic de-termination, expresses also this, that the content really does nothave that determinateness, viz. that of the immediate property,and the qualitative element falls solely in [the determinationof] magnitude, as we saw above."},{"number":281,"text":"Although, then, the objective aspect which is appre-hended as an organic determinateness itself contains the Notionand is thereby distinguished from the object as it presents itselfto the Understanding which, in apprehending the content of OBSERVING REASON 169 its laws, behaves purely as perception, yet apprehension in thefirst case relapses completely into the principle and the mannerof the Understanding that merely perceives. For by so doing,what is apprehended receives the character of a fixed deter-minateness, the form of an immediate property or of an inertphenomenon; furthermore, it is subsumed under the categoryof quantity and the nature of the Notion is suppressed. Theexchange of an object that is merely perceived for one reflectedinto itself, of a merely sensuous determinateness for an organicone, thus loses once more its value and does so by the fact thatthe Understanding has not yet put behind it the formulatingof laws."},{"number":282,"text":"To illustrate this exchange by some examples, we mayfind perhaps that something which perception takes to be an‘animal with strong muscles’ is defined as an ‘animal organismofhigh irritability’, or what perception takes to be a ‘conditionof great weakness’ is defined as a ‘condition of high sensibility’,or, if we prefer it, as an ‘abnormal affection’ and, moreover,a ‘raising ofit to a higher potency —expressions which translatesensuous facts into Latin, and a bad Latin at that, instead ofinto the Notion. That an animal has strong muscles may alsobe expressed by the Understanding by saying that the animal‘possessesa great muscular force’—great weakness meaningsimi-larly a ‘slight force’. Determination in terms of irritability hasthis advantage over determination in terms of force, that thelatter expresses indeterminate, but the former determinate, re-flection-into-self; for the force peculiar to muscle is preciselyirritability; and irritability is a preferable determination to‘strong muscles’, since, as in ‘force’, reflection-into-self isalready directly implied in it. Similarly, weakness or slightforce, organic passivity, is given determinate expression in termsof sensibility. But when this sensibility is so taken by itself andfixed and, in addition, is bound up with quantitative determina-tions and, qua greater or less sensibility, is opposed to a greateror less irritability, each is wholly in the element of sense andis reduced to the ordinary form of a property; what connectsthem is not the Notion but, on the contrary, a quantitative anti-thesis, which becomes a difference lacking any thought-con-tent. Though the indefiniteness of the expressions ‘force’,‘strength’, and ‘weakness’ was thereby eliminated, there now 170 C. (AA.) REASON arises the equally futile, vague floundering-about between theantitheses ofhigher and lower sensibility and irritability as theyincrease and decrease relatively to one another. The determina-tions of greater or lesser sensibility or irritability are no less theunthinking apprehension and expression of a sensuous pheno-menon than are the wholly sensuous determinations of strengthand weakness which are devoid of any thought-content. Thosethoughtless expressions have not been replaced by the Notion;instead, ‘strength’ and ‘weakness’ have been given a determina-tion which, taken solely by itself, is based on the Notion, whichit has for its content, but loses completely this origin and charac-ter. On account of the form of simplicity. and immediacy inwhich this content is made into the aspect of a law, and becausequantity constitutes the element of difference in such determi-nations, the essence of the content, which originally is theNotion and is posited as such, retains the mode of sense-percep-tion, and remains as far removed from being cognized as whendetermined in terms of strength and weakness or by immediatesense-properties."},{"number":283,"text":"Now, there still remains to be considered, solely on itsown account, what the outer aspect of organic being is, and howin it the antithesis of tts inner and outer is determined; just asat first the inner of the whole in relation to its own outer wasconsidered. ."},{"number":284,"text":"The outer, considered by itself, is the structured shape ingeneral, the system of life articulating itself in the element ofbeing, and at the same time essentially the being for an otherof the organism---objective being in its being-for-self.

Ifthese two are considered in relation to a law, the inorganicnature cannot, as we saw above, constitute the aspect of a lawover against the organism, because the latter is at the same timeabsolutely for itself, and has a universal and free relation to in-organic nature."},{"number":285,"text":"To define more precisely, however, the relationship ofthese two aspects in the organic shape, this shape is, in oneaspect, turned against its inorganic nature, while in the otherit is for itself and reflected into itself. The actual organism is themiddle term which unites the being-for-self of life, with the outerin general, or with being-in-itself. The extreme of being-for-self OBSERVING REASON 171 is, however, the inner as an infinite One which takes back intoitself, out of their subsistence and connection with outer Nature,the moments ofshape itself; it is that which, without a contentofits own, gives itselfa content in its shape and appears in shapeas its process. In this extreme where it is a simple negativity ora pure singular, the organism possesses its absolute freedom invirtue of which it is indifferent towards, and secured against,being-for-other, and the determinateness of the moments ofshape. This freedom is at the same time freedom of the momentsthemselves, it is their possibility of appearing as an outer existence,and of being apprehended as such; and just as, in this freedom,they are free and indifferent towards this outer existence, so,too, are they in relation to one another; for the simplicity of thisfreedom is being, or is their simple substance. This Notion, orpure freedom, is one and the same life, no matter how manyand varied its shapes or its being-for-other; it is a matter of in-difference to this stream of life what kind of mills its drives. Now,in the first place it is to be noted that this Notion is not to beunderstood here as it was formerly, when we were consideringthe properly inner in its form of process, or the development ofits moments, but in its form of a simple inner, which constitutesthe purely universal aspect in contrast to the actual living being,or as the element in which the existent members of the [organic]shape have their subsistence. For it is this shape that we are con-sidering here, and in it the essence of life is present as the sim-plicity of subsistence. In the next place, the being-for-other, orthe determinateness of the actual structured shape, is taken upinto this simple universality which is its essence, a determinate-ness which is equally simple, universal, and non-sensuous, andcan only be that which is expressed in number. This determinate-ness is the middle term of the shape which links indeterminatelife with the actual life, simple like the former and determinatelike the latter. That which in the former, the inner, would beexpressed numerically, the outer would have to express in accord-ance with zfs mode as a multiform actuality, viz. as its mannerof life, colour, etc., in general, as the entire host of differenceswhich are developed in the world of appearance."},{"number":286,"text":"If the two aspects of the organic whole—the one beingthe inner, while the other is the outer, in such a way that eachagain has in its own self an inner and an outer—are compared 172 C.

If,therefore, the first inner, because the Notion develops itsmoments in it, made a deceptive promise of laws on accountof the show of necessity in the relationship, the second directlydisclaims doing so, since number shows itself to be the determi-nation of one aspect of its laws.

Whatreally happens here is that the attempted comparison of innerand outer is transferred to inorganic Nature. Here the infiniteNotion is only the essence which is concealed within, or falls with-out in self-consciousness, and no longer, as in the organism, isobjectively present. This relation of inner and outer has thusstill to be considered in its own proper sphere."},{"number":288,"text":"In the first place, that inner aspect ofshape as the simplesingularity of an inorganic thing is specific gravity. As a simplebeing, it can be observed just as well as the determinatenessof number, of which alone it is capable, or, strictly speaking,it can be found by comparing observations; and it seems in thisway to give one aspect of the law. Shape, colour, hardness,toughness, and a countless host of other properties wouldtogether constitute the outer aspect, and would have to giveexpression to the determinateness of the inner, viz. number, sothat the one would have its counterpart in the other."},{"number":289,"text":"Now, because negativity is understood here not as amovement of the process, but as a unity brought to rest, or asa simple being-for-self, it appears rather as that by which the thingresists the process. and inwardly preserves itself, as indifferenttowards it. But, in virtue of the fact that this simple being-for- OBSERVING REASON ` 173 selfis a tranquil indifference towards an other, specific gravityappears as one property alongside others; and with that, all neces-sary relation ofit to this plurality, in other words, all conformityto law, ceases. Specific gravity, as this simple inner, does nothave [the moment of] difference within itself, in other words,the difference it has is only unessential ; for it is just its pure sim-plicity that effaces all essential distinction. This unessential dif-ference, magnitude, must therefore have its counterpart or otherin the other aspect, viz. the plurality of properties, since it isonly through this that it is difference at all. If this plurality itselfis concentrated into the simplicity of the antithesis, and deter-mined, say, as cohesion, so that this cohesion is a being-for-selfin otherness (just as specific gravity is a pure being-for-self), thenthis cohesion is in the first place pure determinateness positedin the Notion in contrast to that other determinateness; andthe way of formulating the law would be that which we con-sidered above, in connection with the relation of sensibility toirritability. In the next place, cohesion, qua Notion of being-for-self in otherness, is further only the abstraction of the aspectstanding over against specific gravity, and as such has no exist-ence. For being-for-self in otherness is the process in which theinorganic would have to express its being-for-self as a self-pre-servation, which would secure it from emerging from the processas moment of a product. But just this is contrary to its nature,which has no purpose or universality in it. Its process, rather,is merely the specific activity in which its being-for-self, i.e. itsspecific gravity, is suspended. But this specific activity itself inwhich its cohesion would exist in its true Notion, and the specificquantity of its specific gravity, are Notions completely in-different towards each other. If the way in which they reactto each other is left out of account, and attention is confinedto the idea of quantity, we could perhaps think of the determi-nation like this, that a greater specific weight, as a more in-tensive being-within-self, would resist involvement in the pro-cess more than would a smaller specific weight. But, conversely,the freedom of being-for-self only proves itself in the ease withwhich it enters into relation with everything, and preserves itselfin this multiplicity. The said intensity without extension of rela-tions is an empty abstraction, for extension constitutes the outerexistence of intension. But the self-preservation of the inorganic 174 C. (AA.) REASON in its relation falls, as we have noted, outside of its nature, sincethe inorganic does not contain within itself the principle ofmovement, or, in other words, because its being is not absolutenegativity and Notion."},{"number":290,"text":"This other aspect of the inorganic, on the other hand,when considered not as process but as a quiescent being, is ordi-nary cohesion, a simple sensuous property standing over againstthe liberated moment of otherness which is separated into anumber of mutually indifferent properties and which, like spe-cific gravity, is one of these properties. The multiplicity of prop-erties together, then, constitutes the other aspect of cohesion.In this, however, as in the other properties, number is the soledeterminateness, and this not only does not express a relationbetween these properties and a transition from one to another,but is essentially just the absence of any necessary relation andit represents rather the abolition of all conformity to law; forit is the expression of a determinateness that is unessential. Thisbeing so, then a series of bodies in which the difference isexpressed as a numerical difference of their specific gravitiesby no means runs parallel to a series in which the differenceis that of the other properties, even if, to facilitate the compari-son, only one or some of them are taken. For, as a matter offact, only the entire bundle of properties could constitute theother series in such a parallel. To bring this into order and bindit into a whole, observation has at its disposal, on the one hand,the quantitative determinatenesses of these various properties ;on the other hand, however, their differences are manifest asqualitative. Now in this heap of properties, what would haveto be characterized as positive or negative and as mutuallycancelling each other—in general, the internal arrangementand exposition of the formula, which would be a very compli-cated matter—this would be for the Notion to determine; butthe Notion is excluded by the very manner in which the proper-ties are immediately there and taken up. In this [mere] being[of the properties], none displays the character of a negativeover against the other; on the contrary, one is just as well asthe other is, nor does it indicate in any other way its place inthe arrangement of the whole. In the case of a series which pro-gresses with parallel differences—whether the relation is meantto be one of simultaneous increase on both sides, or of increase OBSERVING REASON 175 only on one and decrease on the other—what is of interest isonly the final simple expression of this combined whole, whichwas supposed to constitute one aspect of the law over againstspecific gravity ; but this one aspect, as a given result, is preciselynothing else than what has already been mentioned, viz. asingle property, say, like ordinary cohesion, alongside whichthe indifferent others, specific gravity among them, are found,and each of the others can with equal right, i.e. with equal in-correctness, be taken as representative of the entire other side;the one, like the other, would merely represent [repräsentieren],in German, vorstellen, the essential nature, but would not itselfbe that essential nature. So that the attempt to find series ofbodies which would run simply parallel to each other andwould express the essential nature of the bodies according toa law of these two series must be regarded as a conception thatis ignorant of its task and of the means whereby it should becarried out."},{"number":291,"text":"Previously, the connection of inner and outer in theorganic shape, which is supposed to be present to observation,was straightway transferred to the sphere of the inorganic. Thedetermination which produced this transfer can now be moreprecisely indicated, and resulting therefrom we have stillanother form and connection of this relationship. Namely, whatin the case of the inorganic seems to offer the possibility of sucha comparison of inner and outer, in the case of the organismis altogether absent. The inorganic inner is asimple inner whichpresents itself to perception as a property that merely ts; itsdeterminateness is therefore essentially magnitude, and, as aproperty that merely zs, it appears indifferent towards the outer,or the various other sensuous properties. But the being-for-selfof the living organism dces not stand on one side in this wayover against its outer; on the contrary, it has in its own selfthe principle of otherness. If we define being-for-self as simple,self-preserving relation-to-self, then its otherness is simple negativity ;and organic unity is the unity of a self-identical relating-to-selfand pure negativity. This unity is, gua unity, the inwardnessof the organism; this is thereby in itself universal, or it is genus.But the freedom of the genus, in relation to its actual existence,is different from the freedom of specific gravity in relation toshape. That of the latter is a freedom that merely zs, in other 176 C. (AA.) REASON words, specific gravity as a particular property stands on oneside. But because it is a freedom that merely ts, it is also onlya determinateness which essentially belongs to this shape, orwhereby this shape, qua essential being, is something determi-nate. The freedom of the genus, however, is a universal freedomand is indifferent towards this shape or towards its actuality.The determinateness which attaches to the being-for-self of the in-organic as such falls therefore in the case of organic being underits being-for-self, just as, in the case of the inorganic, it falls onlyunder the being of the latter. Hence, although determinatenessin the i inorganic is at the same time present only as a property,yet it acquires the dignity of essential being because, as a simplenegative, it stands over against outer existence which i is a being-for-another; and this simple negative is, in its ultimate singledeterminateness, a number. The organic being, however, is asingular individual, which is itself pure negativity, and there-fore destroys within itself the fixed determinateness whichattaches to indifferent being. In so far, therefore, as it has withinit the moment of indifferent being, and so, too, of number, thislatter can be taken as merely a by-product, but not as theessence of its vitality."},{"number":292,"text":"But now, though pure negativity, the principle of theprocess, does not fall outside of the organism, which thereforedoes not have it in its essence as a determinateness, the singleindividual being itself intrinsically universal, yet in the organ-ism the moments of this pure individual are not developed andactual as moments which are themselves abstract or universal. Onthe contrary, this their expression appears outside of that uni-versality, which falls back into the inwardness of the organism;and between the actual existence or shape, i.e. the self-develop-ing individual, and the organic universal or the genus, therecomes the determinate universal, the species. The concrete exist-ence attained by the negativity of the universal or the genusis only the developed movement of a process which runs itscourse in the parts of the [inert] existence of the shape. If the genus,as a quiescent unitary being, had within it the differentiatedparts, and if, too, its simple negativity as such were at the sametime a movement which ran through parts which were equallysimple and immediately universal in themselves, parts whichhere were actual as such moments, then the organic genus OBSERVING REASON 177 would be consciousness. But, as it is, the simple determinateness,qua determinateness of the species, is present in the genus ina non-spiritual manner; actuality starts from the genus, or,what enters into actual existence is not the genus as such, i.e.in general, not the thought of it. The genus as an actual organ-ism is merely represented by a surrogate, by number. This lat-ter, number, seems to mark the transition from the genus intothe individual structured shape, and to provide observationwith the two necessary aspects of the latter, one as a simpledeterminateness, and the other as a shape whose manifoldnature is fully developed. This number, however, really indi-cates the indifference and freedom of the universal and the in-dividual in relation to one another; the genus puts the indivi-dual at the mercy of the non-essential quantitative difference,but the individual itself, gua living individual, equally showsitself to be free. True universality, as we have defined it, is hereonly an inner essence; as determinateness of the species it is a formaluniversality, and, over against this, the true universality takesits stand on the side of the single individual, which is therebya living individual, and in virtue of its inner being takes noaccount of its determinateness as species. But this individual is notat the same time a universal individual, i.e. one in which theuniversality would have an outer actual existence as well; theuniversal individual falls outside of the living organism. Thisuniversal individual, however, as immediately the individual ofnatural structured shapes, is not consciousness itself; its exist-ence as a single organic living individual must not fall outside ofit if it is to be consciousness."},{"number":293,"text":"Consequently, we have a syllogism in which oneextreme is the universal life as a universal or as genus, the otherextreme, however, being the same universal as a single individual,or as a universal individual; but the middle term is composedof both: the first seems to fit itself into it as a determinate uni-versality or as species, the other, however, as individuality properor as a single individual.

(AA.) REASON series isa system of differences posited as [mutually] indifferent,or is a numerical series. Whereas previously the organism in theform of a single individual was set over against this essencelessdifference, which neither expresses nor contains its livingnature; and whereas just the same must be said in respect ofthe inorganic, taking it as an existence in which the whole ofits properties are developed: it is now the universal individualwe have to consider, and not merely as free from any systemat-ization of the genus, but also as the power controlling the genus.The genus, which divides itself into species on the basis of thegeneral determinateness of number, or which may adopt as itsprinciple of division particular features of its existence, e.g.shape, colour, etc., while peacefully engaged in this activity,suffers violence from the universal individual, the Earth, whichas the universal negativity preserves the differences as they existwithin itself—their nature, on account of the substance to whichthey belong, being different from the nature of those of thegenus—and in face of the systematization of the genus.

It isthus that consciousness, as the middle term between universalSpirit and its individuality or sense-consciousness, has formiddle term the system of structured shapes assumed by con-sciousness as a self-systematizing whole of the life of Spirit—the system that we are considering here, and which has its objec-tive existence as world-history.

Thus, if at firstthe specific nature and innate peculiarity of the individual,together with what these have become as a result of cultivation 190 C. (AA.)

These lineaments and their movements are, accord-ing to this notion, the action which is held back and whichremains in the individual, and as regards the individual’s rela-tion to the action really performed, they constitute his own con-trol and observation of the action, expression in the sense of are flection on the actual expression. The individual is therefore notdumb as regards his external action, because he is thereby atonce reflected into himself, and gives expression to this reflec-tedness-into-self.

We see from a man’s face whether he is inearnest about what he is saying or doing. Conversely, however,what is here supposed to be the expression of the inner is atthe same time an expression in the form of immediate being, andhence is itself degraded to the level of [mere] being, which isabsolutely contingent for the self-conscious being.

The individuality permeatesits shape, moves and speaks in it; but this existence in its entiretyequally turns into a being that is indifferent to the will and thedeed.

The antithesis which this observationencounters has the form of the antithesis of the practical andthe theoretical, both falling within the practical aspect itself—the antithesis of individuality making itself actual in its ‘doing’(‘doing’ in its most general sense), and individuality as beingat the same time reflected out of this ‘doing’ into itself and mak-ing this its object.

In such mere opinion the individuality is infinitely de-termined and determinable. In the accomplished deed thisspurious infinity is destroyed. The deed is something simply de-termined, universal, to be grasped in an abstraction; it ismurder, theft, or a good action, a brave deed, and so on, andwhat it ¿s can be said of it. It is this, and its being is not merelya sign, but the fact itself. It zs this, and the individual humanbeingzs what the deedis. In the simplicity of this being, the indivi-dual is for others a universal being who really is, and who ceasesto be something only ‘meant’. It is true that, in the deed, heis not explicitly present as Spirit; but when it is a question ofhis being ga being, and, on the one hand, the twofold beingof bodily shape and deed are contrasted, each purporting tobe what he actually is, then it is the deed alone that must beaffirmed as his genuine being—not his face or outward appearance,which is supposed to express what he ‘means’ by his deeds, orwhat anyone might suppose he merely could do. Similarly, onthe other hand, when his performance and his inner possibility,capacity or intention are contrasted, it is the former alone whichis to be regarded as his true actuality, even if he deceives himselfon the point, and, turning away from his action into himself,fancies that in this inner self he is something else than what heisin thedeed. Individuality, when it commits itself to the objec-tive element in putting itself into a deed, does of course riskbeing altered and perverted. But what settles the character ofthe deed is just this: whether the deed is an actual being thatendures, or whether it is merely a fancied performance, thatin itself is nothing at all, and passes away.

OBSERVING REASON 197 is by its very nature a fluid system, in which the circles castinto it immediately dissolve, and in which no lasting distinctionis expressed. Meanwhile, as Spirit itself'is not abstractly simple,but a system of movements in which it differentiates itself intomoments, but in this very differentiation remains free; and asSpirit articulates its body into a variety of functions, and allotsone particular part for only one function: so too, the fluid beingof its being-within-self can be thought of as articulated into parts.And it seems that it must be thought of in this way, becausethe being of Spirit which, in the brain, is reflected into itself,is itself again only a middle term between Spirit’s pure essenceand its corporeal articulation, a middle term which thereforemust partake of the nature of both; the corporeal aspect musttherefore also be present in the middle term in the form of imme-diate being."},{"number":328,"text":"The spiritually organic being has at the same time thenecessary aspect of an inert, enduring existence; the former, quathe extreme of being-for-self, must step back, and have this lat-ter as the other extreme over against it, which is then the objecton which the spiritually organic being acts as cause. If now thebrain and spinal cord together constitute that corporeal being-Jor-self of Spirit, the skull and vertebral column form the otherextreme to it, an extreme which is separated off, viz. the solid,inert Thing. When, however, anyone thinks of the proper loca-tion of Spirit’s outer existence, it is not the back that comesto mind but only the head. Therefore, in examining a way ofknowing like the one we are now dealing with, we can besatisfied with this reason—not a very bad reason in this case—in order to confine this existence to the skull. Should it occurto anyone to think of the back as the location of Spirit in sofar as by it, too, knowing and doing are no doubt sometimespartly driven in and partly driven out, this would be no proofat all that the spinal cord must be taken as included in the in-dwelling seat of Spirit, because this proves too much. For onemay equally recall that there are other popular external ways,too, for getting at the activity of Spirit in order to stimulateor inhibit it. The vertebral column is, then, rightly ruled out,if you like; that the skull alone does not contain the organs ofSpirit is as well ‘explained’ as many another doctrine of ‘philo-sophy of Nature’. For this was previously excluded from the 198 C. (AA.) REASON Notion of this relation, and for this reason the skull was takenfor the aspect of outer existence; or, if we are not to be allowedto recall the Notion of the relation, then certainly experienceteaches that, as it is with the eye gua organ that we see, so itis not with the skull that we murder, steal, write poetry, etc.That is the reason why we must also refrain from using theexpression ‘organ’ for that significance of the skull which has stillto be mentioned. For although it is commonly said that reason-able men pay attention not to the word but to the thing itself,yet this does not give us permission to describe a thing in termsinappropriate to it. For this is at once incompetence and deceit,to fancy and to pretend that one merely has not the right word,and to hide from oneself that really one has failed to get holdof the thing itself, i.e. the Notion.

Being itself a part of theorganism, it must indeed be credited, as in the case of everybone, with a living spontaneous formative activity so that, fromthis point of view, it is rather the skull that on its part presseson the brain, and fixes its outer boundary; and it is better ableto do this, being the harder. But in that case the same relationwould still obtain in the determination of their reciprocalactivity; for whether the skull is the determining factor or thefactor determined, this would produce no alteration at all inthe causal connection, except that the skull would then be madethe immediate organ of self-consciousness because in it, quacause, would be found the aspect of being-for-self. But in pointof fact, since being-for-self, as an organic spontaneity, is equallypresent in both, any causal connection between them is ruled OBSERVING REASON 199 out.

The organicspontaneous formation of the skull isin the first place indifferentto any mechanical influence exerted on it, and the relationshipof these two relations, since the former is a relating of itself toitself, is just this very indefiniteness and unboundedness.Furthermore, even if the brain received into itself the dis-tinctions of Spirit as existential distinctions and were a pluralityof internal organs each occupying a different space, it wouldbe left undetermined whether a spiritual feature would, accord-ing as it was originally stronger or weaker, be bound to possessin the first case a more expanded brain-organ, or in the lattercase a more contracted brain-organ, or even the other wayabout. But it is contradictory to Nature for the brain to be sucha plurality of internal organs, for Nature gives the momentsof the Notion an existence of their own, and therefore puts thefluid simplicity of organic life clearly on one side, and its articu-lation and division with its distinctions clearly on the other, sothat in the way they are to be grasped here, they display them-selves as particular anatomical things.

When this influenceis defined, as it were, more imposingly as a ‘stimulation’, it isstill undetermined whether this takes place by swelling, like theeffect of a cantharides plaster, or by shrivelling, like the effectof vinegar.

Over against this being-for-and-within-itself stand its actuality and its existence-for-another.

A variety of ideas may well occurto us in connection with a skull, like those of Hamlet overYorick’s skull; but the skull-bone just by itself is such an in-different, natural thing that nothing else is to be directly seenin it, or fancied about it, than simply the bone itself. It doesindeed remind us of the brain and its specific nature, and ofskulls of a different formation, but not of a conscious movement,since there is impressed on it neither a look nor a gesture, noranything that proclaims itself to have come from a consciousaction; for it is an actuality whose role it is to exhibit anothersort of aspect of the individuality, one that would no longerbe a self-reflected, but a purely zmmediate being."},{"number":334,"text":"Further, while the skull-bone does not itself feel, itseems that perhaps a more specific significance could still befound for it in the fact that specific feelings, through their prox-imity to the skull, might enable us to ascertain what it is thatthe skull means to convey ; and when a conscious mode of Spirithas its feeling in a specific area of the skull, the shape of thispart of the skull might perhaps indicate what that mode is, andwhat is its special nature. Just as, e.g., some people complainof feeling a painful tension somewhere in the head when theyare thinking hard, or even when thinking at all, so too couldstealing, committing murder, writing poetry, and so on, eachbe accompanied by its own feeling, which besides would neces-sarily be localized in its own special place.

If, all the same, the relationis still to exist, what remains and is necessary to form it is anirrational, free, pre-established harmony of the correspondingdetermination of the two aspects; for one of the two aspects isto be a non-spiritual reality, a mere thing.—On the one side,then, we have a multitude of inert areas of the skull, on theother, a multitude of mental properties, whose number andcharacter will depend on the state of psychology. The morepaltry the conception ofSpirit, the easier becomes the task fromthis side; for partly, the mental properties become fewer, andpartly, they become more detached, rigid, and ossified, andtherefore more akin to characteristics of the bone, and morecomparable with them. But, although the task is made mucheasier by the paltry conception of Spirit, yet there still remainsa very great deal to be done on both sides: there remains forobservation the entire contingency of their relation. If the child-ren of Israel, who were likened in number to the sands of thesea-shore, should each take unto himself the grain of sandwhich stood for him, the indifference and arbitrariness of sucha procedure would be no more glaring than that which assignsto every faculty of soul, to every passion, and—what mustequally be considered here—to each nuance of character whichthe more refined psychology and ‘knowledge of human nature’likes to talk about, its particular area of skull and shape of skull-bone. The skull of a murderer has—not this organ or evensign—but this bump. But this murderer has as well a multitudeof other properties, just as he has other bumps, and along withthe bumps also hollows; one has a choice of bumps and hollows.And again, his murderous disposition can be related to anybump or hollow, and this in turn to any mental property; forthe murderer is neither merely this abstraction of a murderer,nor does he h.:ve only one bump and one hollow. The observa-tions indulge: in on this point must, just for that reason, soundas sensible as those of the dealer and of the housewife about OBSERVING REASON 203 rain at the annual fair and on wash-day. Dealer and housewifemight as well make the observation that it always rains whena particular neighbour goes by, or when they eat roast pork.Just as rain is indifferent to circumstances like these, so too,from the standpoint of observation, a particular determinatenessof Spirit is indifferent to a particular formation of the skull. Forof the two objects of this observation, one is a dry, sapless being-for-itself, an ossified property of Spirit, the other is an equallysapless being-in-itself; such an ossified thing as both are is com-pletely indifferent to everything else. It is just as much a matterof indifference to the high bump whether a murderer is in itsvicinity, as it is to the murderer whether flatness is close by him.336. It is of course undeniable that there remains the possi-bility that a bump at some place or other is connected with aparticular property, passion, etc. One can imagine the murdererwith a high bump here at this place on the skull, and the thiefwith one there. From this aspect phrenology is capable of stillgreater expansion; for in the first instance it seems to confineitself to connecting a bump with a property in the same indivi-dual, that is, the individual possesses both. But natural or every-day phrenology—for there must be such a ‘science’ as well asa natural physiognomy—already goes beyond this restriction.It not only declares that a cheating fellow has a bump as bigas your fist behind his ear, but also asserts that, not the unfaith-ful wife herself, but the other conjugal party, has a bump onthe forehead. Similarly, one can zmagine the man who is livingunder the same roof as the murderer, or even his neighbour,or, going further afield, imagine his fellow-citizens, ete. withhigh bumps on some part or other of the skull, just as well asone can imagine the flying cow, that first was caressed by thecrab, that was riding on the donkey, etc. etc. But if possibilityis taken, not in the sense of the possibility of zmagining, but inthe sense of inner possibility, or the possibility of the Notzon, thenthe object is a reality of the kind which is a pure ‘thing’, andis, and should be, without a significance of this sort, and cantherefore have it only in imagination or picture-thinking.337. The observer, ignoring the mutual indifference of thetwo aspects, may nevertheless set to work to determine theirrelations, partly encouraged by the general rational principlethat the outer is the expression of the inner, and partly supported 204 C. (AA.) REASON by the analogy of the skulls of animals—which indeed may wellhave a simpler character than human beings, but of which atthe same time it will be all the harder to say what characterthey do have, since it cannot be easy for anyone really to enterin imagination into the nature of an animal. Should, however,the observer do so, he will find, in assuring us of the certaintyof the laws he claims to have discovered, an excellent aid in adistinction which must necessarily occur to us here too. Thebeing of Spirit cannot in any case be taken as something fixedand immovable. Man is free; it is admitted that the originalbeing consists merely of dispositions, about which a man is freeto do much as he wishes, or which require favourable circum-stances for their development; i.e. an original being of Spirit isequally well to be spoken of as a being that does not exist quabeing. Were observations therefore to conflict with what some-one happens to maintain is a law, should it happen to be fineweather at the annual fair or on wash-day—then dealer andhousewife might say that really it ought to rain, and that the ten-dency to rain is certainly present. So too when observing the skull,it might be said that this individual really ought to be what,according to the law, his skull proclaims him to be, and thathe has an original disposition, but one that has not been de-veloped: this quality is not present, but it ought to be present. The‘law’ and the ‘ought’ are based on observation of actual rainfall,and on the actual significance in the case of this particularcharacteristic feature of the skull; but ifthe reality is not present,the empty possibility serves equally well. This possibility, i.e. non-actuality, of the stated law, and hence the observations conflict-ing with the law, inevitably result from the fact that the freedomof the individual, and the developing circumstances, are in-different to being as such [or to what merely is], indifferent tobeing, both as an original inner and as an outer osseous form,and this also from the fact that the individual can be somethingelse than he is by inner disposition, and still more than whathe is as a bone."},{"number":338,"text":"We get then the possibility that this bump or this hollowon the skull may denote something actual, as well as merelya disposition, one, moreover, that is so ill-defined as to denotesomething that is not actual; we see what happens, as always,to a bad subterfuge, viz. that it is itself ready to be used against OBSERVING REASON 205 what it is supposed to support. We see mere subjective imagin-ing brought by the very nature of the fact to say—but unthink-ingly—the opposite of what it affirms; to say that by this particu-lar bone something or other is indicated, but equally too, is notindicated."},{"number":339,"text":"What such imagining vaguely has in mind in the caseof this subterfuge is the true thought which, in fact, abolishesthat imagining, viz. that being as such is not the truth of Spiritat all. Just as the disposition is itself an original being, which hasno part in the activity of Spirit, just such a being is the boneon its side. What merely ts, without any spiritual activity is,for consciousness, a Thing, and, far from being the essence ofconsciousness, is rather its opposite; and consciousness is onlyactual to itself through the negation and abolition of such abeing. From this point of view it must be regarded as a completedenial of Reason to pass off a bone as the actual existence of con-sciousness; and it is passed off as such when it is regarded asthe outer being of Spirit, for the outer is just that reality whichmerelyzs. Itis no use saying that the inner is only being inferredfrom the outer, and is something different, nor that the outer isnot the inner itself, but only its expression. For in the relationof the two to one another the determination of the reality thatthinks itself, and is in the form of thought, does fall on the sideof the inner; but on the side of the outer, falls the determinationof the reality which merely is. When, therefore, a man is told‘You (your inner being) are this kind of person because yourskull-bone is constituted in such and such a way,’ this meansnothing else than, ‘I regard a bone as your reality’. To reply tosuch a judgement with a box on the ear, as in the case of asimilar judgement in physiognomy mentioned above, at firsttakes away from the soft parts their importance and position,and proves only that these are no true in-itself, are not the realityof Spirit; the retort here would, strictly speaking, have to gothe length of beating in the skull of anyone making such a judge-ment, in order to demonstrate in a manner just as palpable ashis wisdom, that for a man, a bone is nothing in itself, muchless his true reality. ."},{"number":340,"text":"The crude instinct of self-conscious Reason will rejectout of hand such a ‘science’ of phrenology—this other obser-vational instinct of self-conscious Reason which, having 206 C. (AA.) REASON attained to a glimpse of the cognitive process, has grasped itunintelligently in a way that takes the outer to be the expressionof the inner. But the worse the conception, the less sometimesdoes it occur to one wherein its badness specifically lies, andthe harder it is to analyse it. For a conception is said to be worse,the purer and emptier the abstraction which is taken to be itsessence. But the antithesis we are here concerned with has forits sides the individuality that is conscious of itself, and theabstraction of externality that has become wholly a Thing—that inner being of Spirit grasped as a fixed non-spiritual being,opposed to just such a being. But Reason, in its role of observer,having reached thus far, seems also to have reached its peak,at which point it must abandon itself and do a right-about turn;for only what is wholly bad is implicitly charged with the imme-diate necessity of changing round into its opposite. Just so, itmay be said of the Jewish people that it is precisely becausethey stand before the portal of salvation that they are, and havebeen, the most reprobate and rejected : what that people shouldbe in and for it self, this essential nature of its own self, is notexplicitly present to it; on the contrary, it places it beyond itself.By this alienation it creates for itself the possibility of a higherexistence, if only it could take back again into itself its alienatedobject, than if it had remained undisturbed within the imme-diacy of being—because Spirit is all the greater, the greater theopposition from which it has returned into itself; but it createsthis opposition for itself by setting aside its immediate unity,and by alienating its being-for-self. However, if such a con-sciousness does not reflect on itself, the intermediate position,or middle term, which it occupies is an unhappy void, sincewhat should fill and fulfil it has been turned into a fixedextreme.

Of course, the intentionhere is not to state that Spirit, which is represented by a skull,is a Thing; there is not meant to be any materialism, as it iscalled, in this idea; rather Spirit must be something more andother than these bones.

When in other respects it is said of Spirit thatit zs, that it has being, is a Thing, a single, separate reality, thisis not intended to mean that it is something we can see or takein our hands or touch, and so on, but that is what is said; andwhat really is said is expressed by saying that the being of Spiritis a bone."},{"number":344,"text":"Now this result has a twofold significance. One is itstrue meaning, in so far as it is a completion of the outcome ofthe preceding movement of self-consciousness.

Conscious-ness, as well as self-consciousness, is in itself Reason; but onlythat consciousness for which the object is determined as thecategory can be said to have Reason. From this, however, wemust still distinguish the knowledge of what Reason is. The OBSERVING REASON 209 category, which is the immediate unity of being and self, mustpass through both forms, and it is precisely for consciousnessqua observer that the category presents itself in the form of being.This consciousness, in its result, enunciates as a proposition thatof which it is the unconscious certainty—the proposition thatis implicit in the Notion of Reason. This proposition is the infinitejudgement that the self is a Thing, a judgement that suspendsitself. Through this result, then, the category is further deter-mined as being this self-superseding antithesis. The pure cate-gory, which is present for consciousness in the form of being orimmediacy, is the object as still unmediated, as merely given, andconsciousness is equally unmediated in its relation to it. Themoment of that infinite judgement is the transition of immediacyinto mediation, or negativity. The given object is consequentlydetermined as a negative object; consciousness, however, is de-termined as self-consciousness over against it; in other words,the category which, in the course of observation, has runthrough the form of being is now posited in the form of being-for-self: consciousness no longer aims to find itself immediately,but to produce itself by its own activity.

It has no clear consciousness, how-ever, of what is implied in its assertion, and does not grasp thespecific character of the subject and predicate, and their rela-tion in its proposition, still less in the sense of the infinite, self-suspending judgement and of the Notion. Rather, out of a pro-founder self-consciousness of Spirit, which here appears as anatural honesty, it conceals from itself the disgracefulness of theirrational, crude thought which takes a bone for the reality ofself-consciousness ; and it whitewashes that thought by unthink-ingly mixing up with it all sorts of relationships of cause andeffect, of ‘sign’, ‘organ’, etc. which are meaningless here, and'Einheit des Seins und des Seinen. 210 C.

But objectivity proper mustbe an immediate, sensuous objectivity, so that in this dead objec-tivity—for the bone is a dead thing, so far as what is dead ispresent in the living being itself—Spirit is explicitly present asactual.

But when Reason is presented as its own self and itsopposite, and is held fast in the entirely separate moment ofthis asunderness, it is apprehended irrationally; and the purerthe moments of this asunderness, the cruder is the appearanceof this content which is either only for consciousness, or onlyingenuously expressed by it. The depth which Spirit brings forthfrom within—but only as far as its picture-thinking conscious-ness where it lets it remain—and the ignorance of this conscious-ness about what it really is saying, are the same conjunction ofthe high and the low which, in the living being, Nature naivelyexpresses when it combines the organ of its highest fulfilment,the organ of generation, with the organ of urination. The in-finite judgement, gua infinite, would be the fulfilment of lifethat comprehends itself; the consciousness of the infinite judge-ment that remains at the level of picture-thinking behaves asurination.} 'Cf.

Further, the ‘way of theworld’, too, is for virtue not merely this universal which is per-verted by individuality ; on the contrary, the absolute order is like-wise a common moment, only one that is not present for con-sciousness as an existent reality, but as the inner essence of the‘way of the world’. That order, strictly speaking, has not firstto be brought into existence by virtue, for to bring into existenceis, gua action, a consciousness of individuality, and individualityis really what has to be nullified ; but this nullifying of individu-ality merely makes room, as it were, for the in-ztself of the ‘wayof the world’ to enter into existence on its own account."},{"number":382,"text":"The general content of the actual ‘way of the world’ wealready know; looked at more closely, it is again nothing elsebut the two preceding movements of self-consciousness.

The reality is only the individuality of the pleasureand enjoyment to which, however, the universal is opposed, anecessity which is merely the empty form of the universal, amerely negative reaction and an action devoid of content. Theother moment of the ‘way of the world’ is the individualitywhich claims to be law in its own right, and in its own conceitdisturbs the existing order. The universal law, it is true, pre-serves itself in face of this conceit, and no longer makes itsappearance as something opposed to consciousness and emptyof content, as a blind necessity, but as a necessity within conscious-ness itself. But, when it exists as the conscious relation of an abso-lutely contradictory reality, it is madness; as an objective reality,however, it is perversion in general.

This faith virtue proceeds toraise to sight, without, however, enjoying the fruits of its labourand sacrifice. For in so far as it is an individuality, it is the activityof the conflict it wages with the ‘way of the world’; but its aimand true nature is to conquer the reality of the ‘way of theworld’. The bringing into existence of the good thus effectedis thus the cessation of its activity or of the consciousness of indivi-duality.

As a matter of fact, therefore, the knight of virtue’s ownpart in the fighting is, strictly speaking, a sham-fight which hecannot take seriously—because he knows that his true strengthlies in the fact that the good exists absolutely in its own right,i.e. brings itself to fulfilment—a sham-fight which he also darenot allow to become serious. For what he turns against theenemy and finds turned against himself, and what he runs therisk of wasting and damaging both in his own case as well asthat of the enemy, is not to be the good itself; for he fights topreserve and accomplish that.

Andin the actuality of that in-itself, virtue has its own existence,too; for virtue, therefore, the ‘way of the world’ is invulnerable.All the moments which in virtue itself were supposed to berisked and sacrificed, are just such existences of the good, andhence are inviolable relationships. Consequently, the conflictcan only be an oscillation between preserving and sacrificing;or rather there can be neither a sacrifice of what is one’s own,nor a violation of what is alien. Virtue is not merely like thecombatant who, in the conflict, is only concerned with keepinghis sword bright, but it has even started the fight in order topreserve the weapons.

Whatvirtue holds to be an intrinsic being, the ‘way of the world’ regardsas merely an [indifferent] object; it is free from every principlethat virtue holds to be established, and by which it is bound.Such a principle the ‘way of the world’ has in its power, sinceit regards it as something it can either set aside or let be, asit can also the virtuous knight who is fast-bound by it.

But the consciousness of virtue rests on this distinctionbetween the zn-itself and being, a distinction which has no truth.The ‘way of the world’ was supposed to be the perversion ofthe good because it had individuality for its principle; only,individuality is the principle of the real world ; for it is preciselyindividuality that is consciousness, whereby what exists in itselfexists equally for an other; it does pervert the Unchangeable,but it perverts it in fact from the nothing of abstraction into thebeing of reality."},{"number":390,"text":"Thus the ‘way of the world’ triumphs over what, inopposition to it, constitutes virtue, triumphs over that which isthe essenceless abstraction of essence.

In truth,however, it is the reality that is permeated by individuality,actuality as it is present in consciousness qua individual, andit is, in the first instance, posited as [merely] being, not yet asacting. But as regards action, that determinateness is, on the onehand, not a limitation it would want to overcome, for, regardedas an existent quality, it is the simple colour of the element inwhich it moves; on the other hand, however, negativity is adeterminateness only in being; but action is itself nothing else butnegativity. Therefore, when individuality acts, determinatenessis dissolved in the general process of negativity or in the sumtotal of every determinateness."},{"number":400,"text":"In action and the consciousness of action, the simpleoriginal nature now splits up into the distinction which action INDIVIDUALITY REAL IN AND FOR ITSELF 239 implies.

The second moment is the move-ment of the End conceived as passive, and realization conceivedas the relation of the End to the wholly formal actuality, hencethe idea of the transition itself, or the means. The third momentis, finally, the object, which is no longer in the form of an Enddirectly known by the agent to be his own, but as brought outinto the light of day and having for him the form of an ‘other’.The Notion of this sphere requires that these various aspectsbe grasped in such a way that the content in them remains thesame without any distinction, whether between individualityand being in general, or between End as against individualityas an original nature, or between End and the given reality;or between the means and that reality as an absolute End, orbetween the reality brought about by the agent as against theEnd, or the original nature, or the means."},{"number":401,"text":"First of all, then, the originally determinate nature [ornatural predisposition] ofindividuality, its immediate essence, isnot as yet posited as active, and as such is called special capacity,talent, character, and so on. This peculiar tinge of Spirit is tobe looked on as the sole content of the End itself and as thesole reality. If we thought of consciousness as going beyond that,and as wanting to give reality to a different content, then weshould be thinking of it as a Nothing working towards Nothing.Further, this original essence is not merely the content of theEnd, but is in itself the reality as well, which otherwise has theappearance of being a given material of the action, of being areality found to begin with, which is to be shaped by the action.That is to say, action simply translates an initially implicit beinginto a being that is made explicit; the being-in-itself of thereality opposed to consciousness is reduced to a mere emptyshow. This consciousness, then, when bringing itself to act, doesnot let itself be led astray by what is merely the show of a givenreality, and equally it has to avoid floundering about in emptythoughts and Ends, and has to hold on to the original contentofits essence. True, this original content is only explicit for con-sciousness when the latter has made it into a reality; but thedistinction between a content, which is explicit for consciousnessonly within consciousness itself, and an intrinsic reality outside it, 240 C. (AA.) REASON no longer exists. Consciousness must act merely in order thatwhat it is in itself may become explicit for it; in other words,action is simply the coming-to-be of Spirit as consciousness. Whatthe latter is in itself, it knows therefore from what it actually is.Accordingly, an individual cannot know what he [really] is un-til he has made himselfa reality through action. However, thisseems to imply that he cannot determine the End of his actionuntil he has carried it out; but at the same time, since he isa conscious individual, he must have the action in front of himbeforehand as entirely hisoun, i.e. as an End. The individual whois going to act seems, therefore, to find himself in a circle inwhich each moment already presupposes the other, and thushe seems unable to find a beginning, because he only gets toknow his original nature, which must be his End, from the deed,while, in order to act, he must have that End beforehand. Butfor that very reason he has to start immediately, and, whateverthe circumstances, without further scruples about beginning,means, or End, proceed to action; for his essence and intrinsicnature is beginning, means, and End, all in one. As beginning,this nature is present in the circumstances of the action; andthe interest which the individual finds in something is the answeralready given to the question, ‘whether he should act, and whatshould be done in a given case’. For what seems to be a givenreality is in itself his own original nature, which has merely theillusory appearance of an [objective] being—an appearanceimplied in the Notion of action with its twofold aspect, butwhich shows itself to be his own original nature by the interesthe takes in it. Similarly, the ‘how’ or the means is determinedin and for itself. Talent is likewise nothing else but the determi-nate, original individuality considered as an inner means, or asa transition from End to an achieved reality. But the actual meansand the real transition are the unity of talent with the natureof the matter in hand, present in that interest: talent representsin the means the side of action, interest the side of content; bothare individuality itself, as an interfusion of being jand action.What we have, therefore, is a set of given circumstances whichare in themselves the individual’s own original nature; next, theinterest which treats them as its own or as its End; and finally,the union [of these] and the abolition of the antithesis in themeans. This union itself still falls within consciousness and the INDIVIDUALITY REAL IN AND FOR ITSELF 241 whole just considered is one side ofan antithesis. This illusoryappearance of an antithesis which still remains, is removed bythe transition or the means; for the means is a unity of innerand outer, the antithesis of the specific character it has as aninner means. It therefore rids itself of that character and positsitself—this unity of action and being—equally as an outer, asanindividuality that has itself become a reality, i.e. an individu-ality which is posited for individuality itself as [objectively]existent.

Conscious-ness, however, as against the work, is determined as that inwhich the quality is present as negativity in general, i.e. as action;it is thus the universal as against the specific character of thework done. It can therefore compare one work with another,and by so doing grasp individualities themselves as different; itcan regard an individual whose work is more wide-ranging aspossessing greater energy of will or a richer nature, i.e. a naturewhose native quality is less limited; and another, on the otherhand, as a weaker and poorer nature."},{"number":403,"text":"In contrast with this unessential quantitative difference,‘good’ and ‘bad’ would express an absolute difference; but herethis is not in place.

What would be calleda bad work is the individual life of a specific nature, whichtherein gives itself reality. It would only be put down as a badwork by a comparing reflection, which, however, is an idleaffair, since it goes beyond the essential nature of the work,which is to be a self-expression of the individuality, and in itlooks for and demands something else, no one knows what. Thecomparison could only have regard to the above-mentioned dif-ference. But this, being a quantitative difference, is in itself notan essential one; and here, specifically, because the things 242 C.

It is true 'that the consciousness of this unity is likewise a comparison,but what is compared is merely an illusory appearance of anantithesis, an appearance of the form [of antithesis] which, forself-conscious Reason that is aware that individuality in its ownselfis reality, is nothing more than an illusory show.

The work produced is thereality which consciousness gives itself; it is that in which theindividual is explicitly for himself what he is implicitly or inhimself, and in such a manner that the consciousness, for whichthe individual becomes explicit in the work, is not the particu-lar, but the universal, consciousness. In his work, he has placedhimself altogether in the element of universality, in the quality- INDIVIDUALITY REAL IN AND FOR ITSELF 243 less void of being. The consciousness which withdraws from itswork is, in fact, the universal consciousness in contrast to itswork, which is determinate or particular—and it is universalbecause it is absolute negativity or action in this antithesis. Itthus goes beyond itself in the work, and is itself the quality-less void which is left unfilled by its work. But if their unitybefore was preserved in the Notion, this happened simplybecause the work qua existent was sublated. But it is supposedto exist, and we have to see how in its existence the individualitywill preserve its universality, and will know how to satisfy itself. In the first place, we have to consider by itself the work pro-duced. It has received into itself the whole nature of the indivi-duality. Its being is therefore itself an action in which all dif-ferences interpenetrate and are dissolved. The work is thusexpelled into an existence in which the quality of the originalnature in fact turns against other determinate natures,encroaches on them, and gets lost as a vanishing element inthis general process. Although. wzthin the Notion of the objectivelyreal individuality all the moments—circumstances, end,means, and realization—have the same value, and the originalspecific nature has the value of no more than a universal ele-ment, on the other hand, when this element becomes an objec-tive being, its specific character as such comes to light in the workdone, and obtains its truth in its dissolution. More precisely,the form which this dissolution takes is that, in this specificcharacter, the individual, gua this particular individual, hasbecome aware of himself as actual; but the specific characteris not only the content of the reality, but equally its form; inother words, the reality simply as such is just this quality ofbeing opposed to self-consciousness. Looked at from this aspect,the reality is revealed as a reality that has vanished from theNotion, and is merely an alien reality that is found given. Thework is, i.¢. it exists for other individualities, and is for theman alien reality, which they must replace by their own in orderto obtain through their action the consciousness of their unitywith reality; in other words, their interest in the work whichstems from their original nature, is something different from thiswork’s own peculiar interest, which is thereby converted intosomething different.

An individuality sets about carrying out something; byso doing it seems to have made something its own affair; it acts,. and in acting becomes involved with others and seems to itselfto be having to do with reality. The others therefore take itsaction for a sign of its interest in the ‘matter in hand’ as such,and its purpose to be the carrying-out of the matter per se, re-gardless whether this is done by the first individuality or bythem. Accordingly, when they point out that this matter hasalready been accomplished by them, or, ifit has not, offer andfurnish their assistance, then this consciousness has really leftthe position they believe it to occupy; it is its own action andits own effort that constitute its interest in the ‘matter in hand’,and when theothers become aware that this was really the ‘mat-ter in hand,’ then they feel they have been deceived. But actu-ally their eagerness to come and help was itself nothing else buta desire to see and exhibit their own action, not the matter inhand itself; that is, they wanted to deceive the others in justthe same way that they complain of having been deceived.Since it now turns out that its own action and effort, the playof its own powers, is the ‘heart of the matter’, it seems that con-sciousness is occupied with its own interest, not with that ofothers, and is anxious only about action as its own action, notabout action as the action of others, and hence seems to allowthe others to do as they like about the matter they have in hand.But again they are mistaken; that consciousness has already leftthe position they thought it occupied. It is not concerned withthe ‘matter in hand’ as its own particular affair, but simply asa ‘matter in hand’, asa universal, which is for everyone. It inter-feres, therefore in the action and work of others, and, if it canno longer take the work out of their hands, it at least showsan interest in it by passing judgement on it; if it gives it thestamp of its approval and praise, this is meant to imply that,in the work, it praises not only the work itself, but also zs own INDIVIDUALITY REAL IN AND FOR ITSELF 251 generosity and moderation in not having damaged the workas work, nor damaged it by its censure. In showing an interestin the work, it is enjaying its own self; and the work which itcensures is equally welcome to it for just this enjoyment of itsown action which its censure provides.

They pretend that their action and efforts are some-thing for themselves alone in which they have only themselvesand their own essential nature in mind. However, in doingsomething, and thus bringing themselves out into the light ofday, they directly contradict by their deed their pretence ofwanting to exclude the glare of publicity and participation byall and sundry.

On the otherhand, if what is supposed to be essential is merely the doingof it, the employment of powers and capacities, or the expres-sion of this particular individuality, then equally it is learnedby all parties that they all regard themselves as affected andinvited to participate, and instead of a mere ‘doing’, or separateaction, peculiar to the individual who opened up the subject-matter, something has been opened up that is for others as well,or is a subject-matter on its own account. In both cases the samething happens and only has a different significance by contrastwith what was assumed and was supposed to be accepted. Con-sciousness experiences both sides as equally essential moments,and in doing so learns what the nature of the ‘matter in hand’ reallyis, viz. thatit is neither merely something which stands opposedto action in general, and to individual action, nor action whichstands opposed to a continuing being and which would be thefree genus of these moments as its species. Rather is its naturesuch that its being is the action of the single individual and of 252 C. (AA.)

Thus the ‘matter in hand’ nolonger has the character of a predicate, and loses the character-istic of lifeless abstract universality. It is rather substance per-meated by individuality, subject in which there is individualityjust as much gua individual, or qua this particular individual, asqua all individuals; and it is the universal which has being onlyas this action of all and each, and a reality in the fact that thesparticular consciousness knows it to be its own individual realityand the reality of all. The pure ‘matter in hand’ itself is whatwas defined above as ‘the category’, being that is the ‘I’ orthe ‘T that is being, but in the form of thought which is still distin-guished from actual self-consciousness. Here, however, themoments of actual self-consciousness in so far as we call themits content (purpose, action, and reality), and also in so far aswe call them its form (being-for-self and being-for-another), areposited as one with the simple category itself, and the categoryis thereby at the same time the entire content. b. Reason as lawgiver 41g. Spiritual essence is, in its simple being, pure consciousness,and this self-consciousness. The originally determinate nature ofthe individual has lost its positive meaning of being zn itself theelement and the purpose ofits activity ; itis merely a supersededmoment, and the individual is a se/fin the form of a universalself. Conversely, the formal ‘matter in hand’ gets its filling fromthe active, self-differentiating individuality; for the differenceswithin the latter constitute the content of that universal. Thecategory is zn itself, or implicit, as the universal of pure conscious-ness; it is equally for itself or explicit, for the self of consciousnessis equally a moment of it.

This ‘matter in hand’ is thereforethe ethical substance; and consciousness of it is the ethical con-sciousness. Its object is likewise for it the True, for it combinesself-consciousness and being in a single unity. It has the valueof the Absolute, for self-corisciousness cannot and does not wantany more to go beyond this object, for in it, it is in communionwith itself: it cannot, for it is all being and all power; it doesnot want to, for it is the self or the will of this self. The object,is in its own self real as object, for it contains within itself thedistinction characteristic of consciousness; it divides itself into‘masses’ [Massen] or spheres which are the determinate laws ofthe absolute essence. These ‘masses’, however, do not obscurethe Notion, for the moments of being and pure consciousnessand of the self remain enclosed within it—a unity which con-stitutes the essence of these ‘masses’ and which, in this dis-tinction, no longer lets these moments fall apart from oneanother."},{"number":421,"text":"These laws or ‘masses’ of the ethical substance are im-mediately acknowledged.

The commandment, then, willnow run: everyone ought to speak the truth at all times, accord-ing to his knowledge and conviction. Sound Reason, this ethicalSubstance precisely, which knows immediately what is rightand good, will also explain that this condition was already somuch part and parcel of that universal maxim that this is howit meant that commandment to be understood. But, with thisadmission, it in fact admits that already, in the very act ofsaying the commandment, it really violates it. It said: everyoneought to speak the truth; but it meant: he ought to speak itaccording to his knowledge and conviction; thatis to say, whatitsaid was different from what it meant; and to speak otherwisethan one means, means not speaking the truth. The untruthor inapt expression in its improved form now runs: everyoneought to speak the truth according to his knowledge and con-viction at the time. But with this correction, what the proposi-tion wanted to enunciate as universally necessary and intrinsic-ally valid, has really turned round into something completelycontingent. For speaking the truth is made contingent onwhether I can know it, and can convince myself of it; and theproposition says nothing more than that a confused muddle oftruth and falsehood ought to be spoken just as anyone happensto know, mean, and understand it. This contingency of the con-tent has universality merely in the propositional form in whichit is expressed ; but as an ethical proposition it promises a uni-versal and necessary content, and thus contradicts itself by thecontent being contingent. Finally, if the proposition were recti-fied by saying that the contingency of the knowledge and convic-tion of the truth ought to be dropped, and that the truth ought INDIVIDUALITY REAL IN AND FOR ITSELF 255 also to be known, then this would be a commandment whichdirectly contradicts the one we started from. Sound Reason wasat first supposed to possess immediately the capacity to speak thetruth; now, however, it is said that it ought to know, that is tosay, that it does not immediately know what is true. Looking atthis from the side of the content, then this has dropped out inthe demand that we should know the truth; for this refers toknowing in general: we ought to know. What is demanded is, there-fore, really something free of all specific content. But here thepoint in question was about a specific content, a distinction in theethical substance. Yet this immediate determination of the sub-stance is a content which showed itself to be really completelycontingent and which, when raised into universality andnecessity by making the law refer to knowing [instead of to con-tent], in fact vanishes."},{"number":425,"text":"Another celebrated commandment is: ‘Love thyneighbour as thyself.’ It is directed to the individual in his rela-tionship with other individuals and asserts the commandmentas a relationship between two individuals, or as a relationshipof feeling Active love—for love that does not act has no exist-ence and is therefore hardly intended here—aims at removingan evil from someone and being good to him. For this purposeI have to distinguish what is bad for him, what is the appropri-ate good to counter this evil, and what in general is good forhim; i.e. I must love him intelligently. Unintelligent love willperhaps do him more harm than hatred. Intelligent, substantialbeneficence is, however, in its richest and most important formthe intelligent universal action of the state—an action com-pared with which the action ofa single individual, as an indivi-dual, is so insignificant that it is hardly worth talking about.The action of the state is, moreover, of so great a power that,if the action of the individual were to oppose it, and either wereintended to be a downright, explicitly criminal act, or the in-dividual out of love for someone else wanted to cheat the uni-versal out ofits right, and its share in the action, such an actionwould be altogether useless and inevitably frustrated. The onlysignificance left for beneficence, which is a sentiment, is that ofanaction whichis quitesingle and isolated, ofhelpi in [asituationof] need, which is as contingent as it is transitory. Chance deter-mines not only the occasion of the action but also whether it 256 C. (AA.) REASON is a ‘work’ at all, whether it is not immediately undone andeven perverted into something bad. Thus this acting for thegood of others which is said to be necessary, is of such kind thatit may, or may not, exist; is such that, if by chance the occasionoffers, the action is perhaps a ‘work’ and is good, but also per-haps not. This law, therefore, as little has a universal contentas the one we first considered, and does not express, as an abso-lute ethical law should, something that is valid in and for itself.In other words, such laws stop short at Ought, they have noactuality; they are not laws, but merely commandments."},{"number":426,"text":"It is evident, however, from the very nature of the case,that we must give up all idea of a universal, absolute content.For any determinateness placed in the simple substance (whosenature is to be simple) is inadequate to it. The commandmentin its simple absoluteness itself expresses an immediate ethicalbeing; the distinction appearing in it is a determinateness, andtherefore a content subsumed under the absolute universalityof this simple being. Since, then, all idea of an absolute contentmust be given up, it can only claim a formal universality, orthat it is not self-contradictory. For universality that lacks acontent is [merely] formal, and an absolute content itselfis tanta-mount to a distinction which is no distinction, i.e. to absenceof content."},{"number":427,"text":"All thatis left, then, for the making ofa law is the mereform of universality, or, in fact, the tautology of consciousnesswhich stands over against the content, and the knowledge, notof an existing or a real content, but only of the essence or self-identity of a content."},{"number":428,"text":"Theethical nature, therefore, is not itself simply as sucha content, but only a standard for deciding whether a contentis capable of being a law or not, i.e. whether it is or is not self-contradictory.

A distinction within the simple ethical substance is forit an accident which appeared, as we saw in specific command-ments, as the contingency of the knowledge [of the circum-stances], of the circumstances themselves, and of the action.The comparison of that simple being with the determinateness INDIVIDUALITY REAL IN AND FOR ITSELF 257 corresponding to it was made by us; and in that comparisonthe simple substance has shown itself to be a formal universality,or pure consciousness which is free from the content and standsover against it, and is a knowing of it as something determinate.This universality in this way remains the same as what the ‘mat-ter in hand’ itself was. But in consciousness it is something else ;it is namely, no longer the unthinking, inert genus, but isrelated to the particular and regarded as the power over it andas its truth. This consciousness seems at first to be the same pro-cess of testing which formerly we carried out, and it seems thatits action cannot be anything other than what has already hap-pened, viz. a comparison of the universal with the determinateparticular which, as previously, would reveal their disparity.Here, however, the relationship of the content to the universalis different, since the latter has acquired a different significance;it is a formal universality of which the determinate content iscapable, for in that universality the content is considered onlyin relation to itself. When we were testing, the universal puresubstance stood over against the determinateness, which dis-played itself as a contingency of the consciousness into whichthe substance entered. Here, one term of the comparison hasvanished ; the universal is no longer the affirmatively presentand authoritative substance, or that which is right in and foritself, but a simple knowing or a form, which compares a con-tent only with itself, and considers whether it is a tautology.Laws are no longer given, but tested; and for the consciousnesswhich tests them they are already given. It takes up their contentsimply as it is, without concerning itself, as we did, with theparticularity and contingency inherent in its reality; it is con-cerned with the commandment simply as commandment, andits attitude towards it is just as uncomplicated as is its beinga criterion for testing it."},{"number":430,"text":"But that is the reason why this testing does not get veryfar. Just because the criterion is a tautology, and indifferentto the content, one content is just as acceptable to it as its oppo-site. Suppose the question is: Ought it to be an absolute lawthat there should be property? Absolute, and not on groundsof utility for other ends: the essence of ethics consists just inlaw being identical with itself and through this self-identity,i.e. through having its ground in itself, it is unconditioned. 258 C. (AA.) REASON Property, simply as such, does not contradict itself; itis an tso-lated determinateness, or is posited as merely self-identical. Non-property, the non-ownership of things, or a common ownershipof goods, is just as little self-contradictory. That somethingbelongs to nobody, or to the first-comer who takes possessionofit, or to all together, to each according to his need or in equalportions—that is a simple determinateness, a formal thought, likeits opposite, property. Admittedly, if a thing that belongs tono one is considered as a necessary object of a need, then it is neces-sary that it become the property of some particular individual;and the contradiction would stem rather from the freedom ofthe thing being made into a law. But by non-ownership of thething is not meant absolute non-ownership, but that it shallcome into someone’s possession according to the individual’sneed, and, moreover, not in order to be kept, but to be usedimmediately. But to provide for the need in such a completelyarbitrary way is contradictory to the nature of the consciousindividual who alone is under discussion. For such an indivi-dual must think of his need in the form of universality, must pro-vide for the whole of his existence, and acquire a lasting posses-sion. This being so, the idea ofa thing being arbitrarily allottedto the first self-conscious individual who comes along and needsit, does not accord with itself. In a society based on a commonownership of goods, in which provision would be made in ac-cordance with a universal fixed rule, either each receives asmuch as he needs—in which case there is a contradictionbetween this inequality and the essential nature of that con-sciousness whose principle is the equality of individuals---or, inaccordance with that principle, goods will be equally distri-buted, and in this case the share is not related to the need,although such a relationship alone constitutes the very notionof ‘sharing’."},{"number":431,"text":"Still, ifin this way [the notion of] non-property appearscontradictory, this is only because it has not been left as a simpledeterminateness. The same applies to [the notion of] property,if this is resolved into its moments. The single thing that is myproperty is held as such to be something universal, solidly estab-lished, and permanent; but this contradicts its nature, whichconsists in its being used and in vanishing. At the same time,itis held to bemine, something which everyoneelse acknowledges, INDIVIDUALITY REAL IN AND FOR ITSELF 259 and lets alone. The fact, however, that I am acknowledgedimplies rather my equality, my identity, with everyone, andthat is the opposite of exclusiveness. What I possess is a Thing,i.e. something which is for others in general and is only for mein a quite general, undefined way; that J possess it, contradictsits universal thinghood. Consequently, property is just as muchan all-round contradiction as non-property; each containswithin it these two opposed, self-contradictory moments of in-dividuality and universality. But each of these determina-tenesses when thought of as simple, as property or non-property,without explicating them further, is as simple as the other, i.e.isnot self-contradictory. The criterion of law which Reason pos-sesses within itself fits every case equally well, and is thus infact no criterion at all. It would be strange, too, if tautology,the maxim of contradiction, which is admitted to be only aformal criterion for the cognition of theoretical truth, i.e. some-thing which is quite indifferent to truth and falsehood, weresupposed to be more than this for the cognition of practicaltruth."},{"number":432,"text":"In both the above moments, which fill the formeremptiness of spiritual being, the process of placing immediatedeterminatenesses in the ethical substance, and then getting toknow whether they are laws, has been eliminated. The resulttherefore seems to be that neither specific laws nor a knowledgeof them is admissible. But the substance is the consciousness ofitself as absolutely essential being, which, therefore, can giveup neither the distinction within it nor the knowledge of that dis-tinction. That law-giving and the testing of laws have provedto be futile, means that both, when taken singly and in isolation,are merely unstable moments of the ethical consciousness; andthe movement in which they appear has the formal meaningthat the ethical substance thereby exhibits itself as consciousness."},{"number":433,"text":"Inso far as these two moments are more precise deter-minations of consciousness of the ‘matter in hand’, they can beregarded as forms of the honest consciousness which, as previ-ously in the case of its formal moments, now busies itself witha supposed content of the good and the right, and with testingsuch established truth, and fancies that in sound Reason andintelligent insight it possesses that which gives force and validityto commandments. 260 C.

The law, as a specific law, has a contin-gent content; this means here that it is the law of a single con-sciousness and has an arbitrary content. To legislate imme-diately in that way is thus the tyrannical insolence which makescaprice into a law and ethical behaviour into obedience to suchcaprice---obedience to laws which are merely laws and not atthe same time commandments, So, too, the second moment, inso far as it is isolated, means testing the laws, moving the im-movable, means the insolence of a knowledge which arguesitself into a freedom from absolute laws, treating them as analien caprice."},{"number":435,"text":"In both forms, these moments are a negative relationto substance or real spiritual being; or we may say that in themsubstance does not as yet possess its reality, but rather that con-sciousness contains them still in the form of its own immediacy,and that substance is at first only a willing and knowing by thisparticular individual, or the ‘ought to be’ of an unreal com-mandment and a knowledge of formal universality. But sincethese modes have been superseded, consciousness has returnedinto the universal and those antitheses Have vanished.

But since this existent lawis valid unconditionally, the obedience of self-consciousness isnot the serving of a master whose commands were arbitrary,and in which it would not recognize itself. On the contrary,laws are the thoughts of its own absolute consciousness,thoughts which are immediately its own. Also, it does not believein them, for although belief does perceive essential beingit perceives it as something alien to itself. Ethical self-con-sciousness is immediately one with essential being through theuniversality of its self; belief, on the other hand, starts from theindividual consciousness; it is the movement of that consciousnessalways towards this unity, but without attaining to the presenceof its essential being.

Suppose somethinghas been entrusted to me; it is the property of someone elseand I acknowledge this because it is so, and I keep myself un-falteringly in this relationship. If I should keep for myself whatis entrusted to me, then according to the principle I follow intesting laws, which is a tautology, I am not in the least guiltyof contradiction; for then I no longer look upon it as the prop-erty of someone else: to hold on to something which I do notregard as belonging to someone else is perfectly consistent.Alteration of the point of view is not contradiction; for what weare concerned with is not the point of view, but the object andcontent, which ought not to be self-contradictory. Just as Ican—as I do when I give something away—alter the view thatit is my property into the view that it belongs to someone else,without becoming guilty of a contradiction, so I can equallypursue the reverse course. It is not, therefore, because I findsomething is not self-contradictory that it is right; on the con-trary, it is right because it is what is right.

In Reason as observer, this pure unity ofthe J and being, of being for itself and being in itself, is determinedas the in-itself or as being, and the consciousness of Reason findsitself.

Buteach ofthesedivisions ofsubstanceremains Spirit in its entirety;if in sense-perception things have no other substance than thetwo determinations of individuality and universality, here thesedeterminations express only the superficial antithesis of the twosides."},{"number":447,"text":"In the essence we are considering here, individualityhas the meaning of self-consciousness in general, not of a particu-lar, contingent consciousness. In this determination, therefore,the ethical substance is actual substance, absolute Spirit realizedin the plurality of existent consciousnesses ; this spirit is the com-munity which, when we entered the sphere of Reason in iispractical embodiment, was for us absolute essence, and here hasemerged on its own account in its truth as conscious ethical essence,and as essence for the consciousness which here is our object.It is Spirit which is for itself in that it preserves itself in its reflec-tion in individuals; and it is implicitly Spirit, or substance, inthat it preserves them within itself. As actual substance, it is anation, as actual consciousness, it is the citizens of that nation.

For the ethicalpower ofthe state, being the movement of self-conscious action,finds its antithesis in the simple and immediate essence of theethical sphere; as actual universality it is a force actively opposedto individual being-for-self; and as actuality in general it findsin that inner essence something other than the ethical power ofthe state."},{"number":450,"text":"It has already been mentioned that each of the oppo-sites in which the ethical substance exists contains the entiresubstance, and all the moments of its content. If, then, the com-munity is that substance conscious of what it actually does, theother side has the form of immediate substance or substancethat simply is. The latter is thus on the one hand the innerNotion or general possibility of the ethical sphere in general,but on the other hand equally contains within it the momentof self-consciousness. This moment which expresses the ethicalsphere in this element ofimmediacy or [simple] being, or whichis an immediate consciousness of itself, both as essence and as thisparticular self, in an ‘other’, i.e. as a natural ethical com-munity—this is the Family. The Family, as the unconscious, stillinner Notion [ofthe ethical order], stands opposed to its actual,self-conscious existence; as the element of the nation’s actual ex-istence, it stands opposed to the nation itself; as the immediatebeing of the ethical order, it stands over against that orderwhich shapes and maintains itself by working for the universal;the Penates stand opposed to the universal Spirit."},{"number":451,"text":"However, although the Family is immediately deter-mined as an ethical being, it is within itself an ethical entity onlyso far as it is not the natural relationship of its members, or sofar as their connection is an immediate connection of separate,actual individuals; for the ethical principle is intrinsically uni-versal, and this natural relationship is just as much a spiritualone, and it is only as a spiritual entity that it is ethical. Wehave to see what constitutes its peculiar ethical character. In THE ETHICAL ORDER 269 the first place, because the ethical principle is intrinsically uni-versal, the ethical connection between the members of theFamily is not that of feeling, or the relationship oflove. It seems,then, that the ethical principle must be placed in the relationof the individual member of the Family to the whole Family asthe Substance, so that the End and content of what he does andactually is, is solely the Family. But the conscious End motivat-ing the action of this whole, so far as it is directed towards thatwhole, is itself the individual. The acquisition and maintenanceof power and wealth is in part concerned only with needs andbelongs to the sphere of appetite; in part, they become in theirhigher determination something that is only mediated. This de-termination does not fall within the Family itself, but bears onwhat is truly universal, the community; it has, rather, a nega-tive relation to the Family, and consists in expelling the indivi-dual from the Family, subduing the natural aspect andseparateness of his existence, and training him to be virtuous,to a life in and for the universal. The positive End peculiar tothe Family is the individual as such. Now, in order that thisrelationship be ethical, neither he who performs the action, norhe to whom the action refers, can be in an accidental relationshipas happens perhaps in rendering some assistance or service ina particular case. The content ofthe ethical action must be sub-stantial or whole and universal; therefore it can only be relatedto the whole individual or to the individual qua universal. Andthis, again, must not be understood as if it were only imaginedthat doing him a service would promote his total happiness,whereas the service, being an immediate and actual deed, pro-duces only a particular effect on him. Nor must we imaginethat service in the form of education, i.e. in a series of efforts,really has him in his entirety for object, and produces him asa ‘work’; for apart from the purpose which is negatively con-nected with the Family, the actual deed has only a limited con-tent. Finally, just as little should we understand the service asa help in time of need by which in truth the individual in hisentirety is rescued ; for such help is itselfa completely contingentact, the occasion of whichis an ordinary reality which can eitherbe or not be. The deed, then, which embraces the entire exist-ence of the blood-relation, does not concern the citizen, for hedoes not belong to the Family, nor the individual who is to 270 C. (BB.) SPIRIT become a citizen and will cease to count as this particular in-dividual; it has as its object and content this particular indivi-dual who belongs to the Family, but is taken as a universal beingfreed from his sensuous, i.e. individual, reality. The deed nolonger concerns the living but the dead, the individual who,aftera longsuccession ofseparate disconnected experiences, con-centrates himself into a single completed shape, and has raisedhimself out of the unrest of the accidents of life into the calmof simple universality. But because it is only as a citizen thathe is actual and substantial, the individual, so far as he is nota citizen but belongs to the Family, is only an unreal impotentshadow."},{"number":452,"text":"This universality which the individual as such attainsis pure being, death; it is a state which has been reached imme-diately, in the course of Nature, not the result of an action con-sciously done. The duty of the member of a Family is on thataccount to add this aspect, in order that the individual’s ulti-mate being, too, shall not belong solely to Nature and remainsomething irrational, but shall be something done, and the rightof consciousness be asserted in it. Or rather, the meaning ofthe action is that because in truth the calm and universalityof a self-conscious being do not belong to Nature, the illusoryappearance that the death of the individual results from a con-scious action on the part of Nature may be dispelled, and thetruth established. What Nature did in the individual is thataspect in which his development into a universal is exhibitedas the movement of an [immediate] existent. This movementfalls, it is true, within the ethical community, and has this forits End; death is the fulfilment and the supreme ‘work’which the individual as such undertakes on its behalf. But inso far as he is essentially a particular individual, it is an accidentthat his death was directly connected with his ‘work’ for theuniversal and was the result of it; partly because, if his deathwas such a result, it is the natural negativity and movement ofthe individual as a [mere] existent, in which consciousness doesnot return into itself and become self-consciousness; or partlybecause, since the movement of what [merely] exists consistsin its being superseded and becoming a being-for-self, deathis the side of diremption in which the attained being-for-selfis something other than the mere existent which began the THE ETHICAL ORDER 271 movement. Because the ethical order is Spirit in its immediatetruth, the sides into which its consciousness sunders itself alsofall into this form of immediacy, and individuality passes overinto this abstract negativity which, being in its own self withoutconsolation and reconciliation, must receive them essentiallythrough a real and external act. Blood-relationship supplements,then, the abstract natural process by adding to it the movementof consciousness, interrupting the work of Nature and rescuingthe blood-relation from destruction; or better, because destruc-tion is necessary, the passage of the blood-relation into merebeing, it takes on itself the act of destruction. Through this itcomes about that the dead, the universal being, becomes a beingthat has returned into itself, a being-for-self, or, the powerless,simply isolated individual has been raised to universal individu-ality. The dead individual; by having liberated his being fromhis action or his negative unity, is an empty singular, merelya passive being-for-another, at the mercy of every lowerirrational individuality and the forces of abstract material ele-ments, all of which are now more powerful than himself: theformer on account of the life they possess, the latter on accountof their negative nature. The Family keeps away from the deadthis dishonouring of him by unconscious appetites and abstractentities, and puts its own action in their place, and weds theblood-relation to the bosom of the earth, to the elementalimperishable individuality. The Family thereby makes him amember of a community which prevails over and holds undercontrol the forces of particular material elements and the lowerforms of life, which sought to unloose themselves against himand to destroy him. 453- This last duty thus constitutes the perfect divine law, orthe’positive ethical action towards the individual. Every otherrelationship to him which does not remain one simply of lovebut is ethical, belongs to human law and has the negative sig-nificance of raising the individual above his confinement withinthe natural community to which he in his [natural] existencebelongs. Now, although human right has for its content andpower the actual ethical substance that is conscious of itself,i.e. the entire nation, while the divine right and law has for itscontent and power the individual who is beyond the real world,yet he is not without power. His power is the abstract, pure 272 C. (BB.) SPIRIT universal, the elemental individual which equally draws back intothe pure abstraction which is its essence the individuality thatbreaks loose from the element, and constitutes the self-consciousreality of the nation---draws it back into the essence which isits ground. How this power is manifested in the Notion itself,we shall see in the ensuing development."},{"number":454,"text":"Now, in the one law as in the other there are also dif-ferences and gradations. For since both laws have within themthe moment of consciousness, difference is developed within thelaws themselves, and this constitutes their movement and theirown peculiar life. Consideration of these differences reveals theway in which they operate, and the mode of self-consciousnessof the two universal essential natures of the ethical world, andalso their connection and transition into one another."},{"number":455,"text":"The community, the superior law whose validity is openlyapparent, has its real vitality in the governmentas that in whichit has an individual form. Government is the reality of Spiritthat is reflected into itself, the simple self of the entire ethicalsubstance. This simple power does indeed allow the Family toexpand into its constituent members, and to give to each partan enduring being and a being-for-self of its own. Spirit hasin this its reality or its objective existence, and the Family isthe element of this reality. But Spirit is at the same time the powerof the whole, which brings these parts together again into anegative unity, giving them the feeling of their lack of indepen-dence, and keeping them aware that they have their life onlyin the whole. The community may, on the one hand, organizeitself into systems of personal independence and property, oflaws relating to persons and things; and, on the other hand,the various ways of working for Ends which are in the first in-stance particular Ends—those of gain and enjoyment—it mayarticulate into their own special and independent associations.The Spirit of universal assembly and association is the simpleand negative essence of those systems which tend to isolatethernselves. In order not to let them become rooted and set inthis isolation, thereby breaking up the whole and letting the[communal] spirit evaporate, government has from time totime to shake them to their core by war. By this means thegovernment upsets their established order, and violates theirright to independence, while the individuals who, absorbed in THE ETHICAL ORDER 273 their own way of life, break loose from the whole and striveafter the inviolable independence and security of the person,are made to feel in the task laid on them their lord and master,death. Spirit, by thus throwing into the melting-pot the stableexistence of these systems, checks their tendency to fall awayfrom the ethical order, and to be submerged in a [merely]natural existence; and it preserves and raises conscious self intofreedom and its own power. The negative essence shows itselfto be the real power of the community and the force of its self-preservation. The community therefore possesses the truth andthe confirmation of its power in the essence of the Divine Lawand in the realm of the nether world."},{"number":456,"text":"The Divine Law which governs the family has likewiseonits side differences within itself whose interrelationships con-stitute the living process of its actuality. But among the threerelationships, of husband and wife, parents and children,brothers and sisters, the relationship of husband and wife is inthe first place the one in which one consciousness immediatelyrecognizes itself in another, and in which there is knowledgeof this mutual recognition. Because this self-recognition is anatural and not an ethical one, it is only a representation, animage of Spirit, not actually Spirit itself. A representation orimage, however, has its actual existence in something otherthan itself. This relationship therefore has its actual existencenot in itself but in the child—an ‘other’, whose coming intoexistence is the relationship, and is also that in which the rela-tionship itself gradually passes away; and this alternation ofsuccessive generations has its enduring basis in the nation. Thedutiful reverence of husband and wife towards each other isthus mixed with a natural relation and with feeling, and thereturn-into-self of the relationship does not take place withinthe relationship itself; similarly with the second relationship,the dutiful reverence of parents and children towards oneanother. That of parents towards their children is emotionallyaffected by the fact that the objective reality of the relationshipdoes not exist in them, but in the children, and by their witness-ing the development in the children ofan independent existencewhich they are unable to take back again; the independent ex-istence of the children remains an alien reality, a reality all itsown. That of children towards parents is emotionally affected, 274 C. (BB.) SPIRIT conversely, by the fact that they derive their existence from, orhave their essential being in, what is other than themselves, andpasses away, and by their attaining independence and aself-consciousness of their own only by being separated fromtheir source—a separation in which the source dries up."},{"number":457,"text":"Both these relationships are confined within the transi-tion and the disparity of the sides which are assigned to them.The relationship in its unmixed form is found, however, in thatbetween brother andsister. They are the same blood which has,however, in them reached a state of rest and equilibrium.Therefore, they do not desire one another, nor have they givento, or received from, one another this independent being-for-self; on the contrary, they are free individualities in regard toeach other. Consequently, the feminine, in the form of thesister, has the highest intuitive awareness of what is ethical. Shedoes not attain to consciousness of it, or to the objective existenceof it, because the law of the Family is an implicit, inner essencewhich is not exposed to the daylight of consciousness, butremains an inner feeling and the divine element that is exemptfrom an existence in the real world. The woman is associatedwith these household gods [Penates] and beholds in them bothher universal substance and her particular individuality, yetin such a way that this relation of her individuality to themis at the same time not the natural one of desire. As a daughter,the woman must now see her parents pass away with a naturalemotion and ethical resignation, for it is only at the cost of thisrelationship that she can achieve that existence of her own ofwhich she is capable. Thus in the parents, she does not beholdher own being-for-self in a positive form. The relationships ofmother and wife, however, are those of particular individuals,partly in the form of something natural pertaining to desire,partly in the form of something negative which sees in thoserelationships only something evanescent and also, again, theparticular individual is for that very reason a contingent ele-ment which can be replaced by another individual. In the ethi-cal household, it is not a question of this particular husband,this particular child, but simply of husband and children gener-ally; the relationships of the woman are based, not on feeling,but on the universal. The difference between the ethical lifeof the woman and that of the man consists just in this, that in THE ETHICAL ORDER 275 her vocation as an individual and in her pleasure, her interestis centred on the universal and remains alien to the particularityof desire ; whereas in the husband these two sides are separated ;and since he possesses as a citizen the self-conscious power ofuniversality, he thereby acquires the right of desire and, at thesame time, preserves his freedom in regard to it. Since, then,in this relationship of the wife there is an admixture of particu-larity, her ethical life is not pure; but in so far as it zs ethical,the particularity is a matter of indifference, and the wife is with-out the moment of knowing herself as this particular self in theother partner. The brother, however, is for the sister a passive,similar being in general ; the recognition ofherselfin him is pureand unmixed with any natural desire. In this relationship,therefore, the indifference of the particularity, and the ethicalcontingency of the latter, are not present; but the moment ofthe individual self, recognizing and being recognized, can hereassert its right, because it is linked to the equilibrium of theblood and is a relation devoid of desire. The loss of the brotheris therefore irreparable to the sister and her duty towards himis the highest.1"},{"number":458,"text":"This relationship is at the same time the limit at whichthe self-contained life of the Family breaks up and goes beyonditself.

Neither of the two is by itself abso-lutely valid; human law proceeds in its living process from thedivine, the law valid on earth from that of the nether world,the conscious from the unconscious, mediation from imme-diacy—and equally returns whence it came.

Or, again, it is in knowing that the law of hisown heart is the law ofall hearts, in knowing the consciousnessof the self as the acknowledged universal order; it is virtue,which enjoys the fruits of its sacrifice, which brings about whatit sets out to do, viz. to bring forth the essence into the lightof day, and its enjoyment is this universal life. Finally, con-sciousness of the ‘matter in hand’ itself finds satisfaction in thereal substance which contains and preserves in a positive man-ner the abstract moments of that empty category.

The Justice, however,which brings back to equilibrium the universal in its ascen-dancy over the individual is equally the simple Spirit of theindividual who has suffered wrong; it is not split up into two,the one who has suffered the wrong and an entity in a remotebeyond. The individual himself is the power of the netherworld, and it is As Erinys, his ‘fury’, which wreaks vengeance.For his individuality, his blood, still lives on in the household,his substance has an enduring reality. The wrong which canbe inflicted on the individual in the ethical realm is simply this, 278 C. (BB.) SPIRIT thatsomething merely happens to him. The power which inflictsthis wrong on the conscious individual of making him into amere Thing, is Nature; it is the universality not of the community,but the abstract universality of mere being; and the individual,in avenging the wrong he has suffered, does not turn againstthe former, for it is not at its hands that he has suffered, butagainst the latter.

In it there is no capriceand equally no struggle, no indecision, since the making andtesting of law has been given up; on the contrary, the essenceof ethical life is for this consciousness immediate, unwavering,without contradiction. Consequently, we are not faced with thesorry spectacle ofa collision between passion and duty, nor withthe comic spectacle of a collision between duty and duty—acollision which, as regards its content, is the same as thatbetween passion and duty; for passion is equally capable ofbeing seen as a duty, because when consciousness separates itselffrom its immediate, substantial essence and withdraws intoitself, it becomes the merely formal universal into which onecontent as well as another fits equally well as we found before.But the collision of duties is comic because it expresses a con-tradiction, viz. the contradiction of an Absolute that is opposedto itself: an Absolute, and then the nothingness of this so-called 280 C.

This immediate firmness ofdecision is something implicit, and therefore has at the sametime the significance ofa natural being as we have seen.

For this reason,the opposition between them appears as an unfortunate collisionof duty merely with a reality which possesses no rights of itsown. The ethical consciousness is, gua self-consciousness, in thisopposition and as such it at once proceeds to force into subjec-tion to the law which it accepts, the reality which is opposedto it, or else to outwit it.

But at the same time this right of the essence does notstand over against self-consciousness, as if the essence existedsomewhere else; on the contrary, it is self-consciousness’s ownessence; it has its existence and its power in self-consciousnessalone, and its antithesis is the act of self-consciousness itself. Forthis latter, just because it is a self to itself and advances to action,raises itself out of simple immediacy, and spontaneously splitsitself into two. By this act it gives up the specific quality of theethical life, of being the simple certainty of immediate truth,and initiates the division of itself into itself as the active prin-ciple, and into the reality over against it, a reality which, forit, is negative. By the deed, therefore, it becomes guilt. For thedeed is its own doing, and ‘doing’ is its inmost nature. And theguilt also acquires the meaning of crime; for as simple, ethicalconsciousness, it has turned towards one law, but turned itsback on the other and violates the latter by its deed. Guilt isnot an indifferent, ambiguous affair, as if the deed as actuallyseen in the light of day could, or perhaps could not, be the actionof the self, as if with the doing of it there could be linked some-thing external and accidental that did not belong to it, fromwhich aspect, therefore, the action would be innocent. On thecontrary, the action is itself this splitting into two, this explicitself-affrmation and the establishing over against itself of analien external reality ; that there is such a reality, this stems fromthe action itself and results from it.

As regards content, however, the ethical action con-tains the moment of crime, because it does not do away withthe natural allocation of the twolaws to the twosexes, but rather,being an undivided attitude towards the law, remains withinthe sphere of natural immediacy, and, qua action, turns this one-sidedness into guilt by seizing on only one side of the essence,and adopting a negative attitude towards the other, i.e. violat-ing it. The place in the universal ethical life of guilt and crime,of deeds and actions, will find more definite expression later;but this much is immediately evident, that it is not this particu-lar individual who acts and is guilty; for as-this self he is onlythe unreal shadow, or he exists merely as a universal self, andindividuality is purely the formal moment of the action as such,the content being the laws and customs which, for the indivi- THE ETHICAL ORDER 283 dual, are those of his class and station.

In the action, onlyone aspect of the resolve as such is clearly manifest. The resolve,however, is in itself the negative aspect which confronts theresolve with an ‘other’, with something alien to the resolvewhich knows what it does. Actuality therefore holds concealedwithin it the other aspect which is alien to this knowledge, anddoes not reveal the whole truth about itself to consciousness:the son does not recognize his father in the man who haswronged him and whom he slays, nor his mother in the queenwhom he makes his wife. In this way, a power which shuns thelight of day ensnares the ethical self-consciousness, a powerwhich breaks forth only after the deed is done, and seizes thedoer in the act. For the accomplished deed is the removal ofthe antithesis between the knowing self and the actuality con-fronting it. The doer cannot deny the crime or his guilt: thesignificance of the deed is that what was unmoved has beenset in motion, and that what was locked up in mere possibilityhas been brought out into the open, hence to link together theunconscious and the conscious, non-being with being.

The latter has a right against the former,because this is only true Spirit, is only in an immediate unity withits substance. On the side of content, it is the clash betweendivine and human law. The youth comes away from the uncon-scious Spirit of the Family, and becomes the individuality ofthe community. But that he still belongs to the Nature fromwhich he wrenched himself free is evidenced by the fact thathe emerges in the contingent form of two brothers, each ofwhom with equal right takes possession of the community; theinequality of the earlier and later birth, an inequality whichis a natural difference, has no importance for them when theyenter the ethical life of the community. But the government, 286 C. (BB.)

These two brothers therefore fall into disputeand their equal right to the power of the state destroys themboth, for they were equally wrong. Looked at from the humanpoint of view, the one who has committed the crime is the onewho, not being in actual possession, attacks the community atthe head of which the other stood, while, on the other hand,he has right on his side who knew how to apprehend the othermerely as an isolated individual, detached from the com-munity, and, taking advantage of his powerlessness, banishedhim; he has struck only at the individual as such, not the com-munity, not at the essence of human right. The community,attacked and defended by what is merely particular, and sowithout a substantial content, preserves itself, and the brothersbring about their own destruction through their reciprocalaction. For individuality, which for the sake of its being-for-self, puts the whole in peril, has expelled itself from the com-munity, and is the source of its own destruction. The com-munity, however, will honour the one who was found on itsside; but the government, the restored unitary self of thecommunity, will punish him who already proclaimed itsdevastation on the walls of the city, by depriving him of thelast honour. He who wantonly attacked the Spirit’s highestform of consciousness, the Spirit of the community, must bestripped of the honour of his entire and finished being, thehonour due to the Spirit of the departed."},{"number":474,"text":"But if the universal thus easily knocks off the very tipof the pyramid and, indeed, carries off the victory over therebellious principle of pure individuality, viz. the Family, it hasthereby merely entered on a conflict with the divine law, a con-flict of self-conscious Spirit with what is unconscious. For thelatter is the other essential power, and is therefore not de-stroyed, but merely wronged, by the conscious Spirit. But ithas only the bloodless shade to help it in actually carrying outits law in face of the power and authority of that other, publiclymanifest law. Being the law of weakness and darkness it there-fore at first succumbs to the powerful law of the upper world,for the power of the former is effective in the underworld, not THE ETHICAL ORDER 287 on earth. But the outwardly actual which has taken away fromthe inner world its honour and power has in so doing consumedits own essence. The publicly manifest Spirit has the root ofits power in the nether world. The self-certainty and self-assurance of a nation possesses the truth of its oath, which bindsall into one, solely in the mute unconscious substance of all,in the waters of forgetfulness. Thus it is that the fulfilment ofthe Spirit of the upper world is transformed into its opposite,and it learns that its supreme right is a supreme wrong, thatits victory is rather its own downfall. The dead, whose rightis denied, knows therefore how to find instruments of ven-geance, which are equally effective and powerful as the powerwhich has injured it. These powers are other communitieswhose altars the dogs or birds defiled with the corpse, whichis not raised into unconscious universality by being given back,as is its due, to the elemental individuality [the earth], butremains above ground in the realm of outer reality, and hasnow acquired as a force of divine law a self-conscious, realuniversality. They rise up in hostility and destroy the com-munity which has dishonoured and shattered its own power,the sacred claims of the Family. 475- In this representation, the movement of human anddivine law finds its necessity expressed in individuals in whomthe universal appears as a ‘pathos’, and the activity of the move-ment appears as the action of individuals, which gives theappearance of contingency to the necessity of the activity. Butindividuality and action constitute the principle of individu-ality assuch, a principle which in its pure universality was calledinner divine law. As a moment of the visible community itsactivity is not confined merely to the underworld, or to its outerexistence, but it has an equally visible existence and movementin the actual nation. Taken in this form, what was representedas a simple movement of the individualized ‘pathos’ acquiresa different look, and the crime and consequent destruction ofthe community acquire the proper and characteristic form oftheir existence. Human law in its universal existence is the com-munity, in its activity in general is the manhood of the com-munity, in its real and effective activity is the government. Itis, moves, and maintains itself by consuming and absorbing intoitself the separatism of the Penates, or the separation into 288 C. (BB.) SPIRIT independent families presided over by womankind, and by keep-ing them dissolved in the fluid continuity of its own nature. Butthe Family is, at the same time, in general its element, the in-dividual consciousness the basis of its general activity. Since thecommunity only gets an existence through its interference withthe happiness of the Family, and by dissolving [individual] self-consciousness into the universal, it creates for itself in what itsuppresses and whatis at the same time essential to it an internalenemy—womankind in general. Womankind—the everlastingirony [in the life] of the community—changes by intrigue theuniversal end of the government into a private end, transformsits universal activity into a work of some particular individual,and perverts the universal property of the state into a possessionand ornament for the Family. Woman in this way turns to ridi-cule the earnest wisdom of mature age which, indifferent topurely private pleasures and enjoyments, as well as to playingan active part, only thinks of and cares for the universal. Shemakes this wisdom an object of derision for raw and irrespon-sible youth and unworthy of their enthusiasm. In general, shemaintains that it is the power of youth that really counts: theworth of the son lies in his being the lord and master of themother who bore him, that of the brother as being one in whomthe sister finds man on a level of equality, that of the youthas being one through whom the daughter, freed from her depen-dence [on the family] obtains the enjoyment and dignity ofwifehood. The community, however, can only maintain itselfby suppressing this spirit of individualism, and, because it isan essential moment, all the same creates it and, moreover, cre-ates it by its repressive attitude towards it as a hostile principle.However, this principle, being merely evil and futile in itsseparation from the universal end, would be quite ineffectualif the community itself did not recognize the power of youth(the manhood which, while immature, still stands within thesphere of individuality), as the power of the whole. For the com-munity is a nation, is itself an individuality, and essentially isonly such for itself by other individualities being for it, byexcluding them from itselfand knowing itself to be independentof them. The negative side of the community, suppressing theisolation of individuals within it, but spontaneously active in anoutward direction, finds its weapons in individuality.

Personal independence in the sphere oflegal right is really a similar general confusion and reciprocaldissolution of this kind. For what counts as absolute, essentialbeing is self-consciousness as the sheer empty unit of the person.In contrast to this empty universality, substance has the formof fulness and content, and this content is now set free and is un-organized; for the Spirit that subdued it and held it togetherin its unity is no longer present. This empty unit of the personis, therefore, in its reality a contingent existence, and essentiallya process and an action that comes ‘to no lasting result. LikeScepticism, the formalism of legal right is thus by its very naturewithout a peculiar content of its own; it finds before it a mani-fold existence in the form of ‘possession’ and, as Scepticism did,stamps it with the same abstract universality, whereby it iscalled ‘property’.

Since, how-ever, thought is in the first instance [only] the element of thisworld, consciousness only Aas these thoughts, but as yet it doesnot think them, or is unaware that they are thoughts; they existfor consciousness in the form of picture-thoughts. For it steps outofits actual world into pure consciousness, yet is itself generallystill in the sphere of the actual world and its determinateness.The disrupted consciousness is only in itself, or implicitly, theself-identity of pure consciousness, a fact that is known to us, butnot to itself.

At thesame time, the other aspect has already come to view. Pure con-sciousness, namely, is reflection out of the world of culture insuch a way that the Substance of that world, and also the‘masses’ or groups into which it is articulated, are shown to bewhat they are in themselves, spiritual essentialities, absolutelyrestless processes or determinations which are directly cancelledin their opposite. Their essence, simple consciousness, is thusthe simplicity of absolute difference which is at once no difference.Consequently, it is pure being-for-self, not as this single self butas the immanently universal self in the form of a restless processwhich attacks and pervades the passive essence of the ‘matterin hand’. In it is thus to be found the certainty that at onceknows itself to be the truth, pure thought as the absolute Notionin the might of its negativity, which eliminates everything objec-tive that supposedly stands over against consciousness, andmakes it into a being which has its origin in consciousness. Thispure consciousness is at the same time equally simple, justbecause its difference is no difference.

Forcedback into itself out of the essenceless, merely dissolving world,Spirit, in accordance with its truth, is in an undivided unity,atonce the absolute movement and negativity of its process of mani-festation, as well as its inwardly satisfied essence and its positiverepose. But coming generally under the determinateness ofalienation, these two moments fall apart into a dual conscious-ness. The former is pure insight as the spiritual process whichfocuses itself in se/f-consciousness, a process which is confrontedby consciousness of what is positive, the form of objectivity orof picture-thinking, and which turns against it; but pure 324 C. (BB.) SPIRIT insight’s own object is only the pure ‘P. The simple consciousnessof the positive, or of tranquil self-identity, on the other hand,has for its object the inner essence qua essence. Pure insight has,therefore, in the first instance, no content of its own, becauseit is negative being-for-self; to faith, on the other hand, therebelongs a content, but without insight. If the former does notstep outside self-consciousness, the latter certainly has its con-tent in the element of pure self-consciousness, but in thought,not in Notions, in pure consciousness, not in pure self-consciousness.Hence faith is certainly pure consciousness of essence, i.e. of thesimple inner being, and thus is thought—the cardinal factor inthe nature of faith, which is usually overlooked. The immediacyof the presence of essence in it is due to the fact that its objectis essence, i.e. pure thought. This immediacy, however, so far asthought enters into consciousness, or pure Consciousness enters intoself-consciousness, acquires the significance of an objective beingwhich lies beyond the consciousness of the self. It is throughthis significance which the immediacy and simplicity of purethought obtains in consciousness, that the essence of faith is nolonger a [pure] thought, but is reduced to the level of somethingimagined, and becomes a supersensible world which is essenti-ally an ‘other’ in relation to self-consciousness. In pure insight,on the other hand, the transition of pure thought into conscious-ness has the opposite determination; objectivity has the signifi-cance of a merely negative content, a content which is reducedto a moment and returns into the self; that is to say, only theself is really the object of the self, or the object only has truth sofar as it has the form of the self."},{"number":530,"text":"Just as faith and pure insight belong in common to theelement of pure consciousness, so also are they in common thereturn from the actual world of culture.

Genius, talent, specialcapacities generally, belong to the world of actuality, in so faras this world still contains the aspect of being a spiritual animalkingdom in which individuals, amid confusion and mutual vio-lence, cheat and struggle over the essence of the actual world.These differences, it is true, have no place in this world as honestespèces ; individuality neither is contented with the unreal ‘mat-ter in hand’ itself nor has it a particular content and endsof its own. On the contrary, it counts merely as something uni-versally acknowledged, viz. as an educated individuality; andthe difference is reduced toone of less or more energy, a quantita-tive difference, i.e. a non-essential difference. This last dif-ference, however, has been effaced by the fact that in the com-pletely disrupted state of consciousness difference changedround into an absolutely qualitative difference. There, whatis for the ‘I’ an ‘other’ is only the ‘I’ itself. In this infinite judge-ment all one-sidedness and peculiarity of the original being-for-self has been eradicated; the self knows itself gua pure self‘to be its own object; and this absolute identity of the two sidesis the element of pure insight. Pure insight is, therefore, thesimple, immanently differentiated essence, and equally the uni-versal work or achievement and a universal possession. In thissimple spiritual substance, self-consciousness gives itself and pre-serves for itself in every object the consciousness of this its own 328 C. (BB.) SPIRIT particular being or of its own action, just as conversely, theindividuality of self-consciousness is therein self-identical anduniversal.

Here, therefore, pure insight can have noactivity and content of its own and thus can only behave asthe formal and faithful apprehension of its own brilliant insightinto the world and of its own peculiar language. Since this lan-guage is that ofa distracted mind, and the pronouncement onlysome twaddle uttered on the spur of the moment, which is againquickly forgotten, and exists as a whole only for a third con-sciousness, this latter can only be distinguished as pure insightif it brings these scattered traits into a general picture and thenmakes them into an insight for everyone."},{"number":540,"text":"By this simple means it will clear up the confusion ofthis world.

Whatever wedges of any sort may be driven into con-sciousness, it is in itself this simplicity in which everything is dis-solved, forgotten, and unbiased, and which therefore is abso-lutely receptive to the Notion. It is on this account that thecommunication of pure insight is comparable to a silent expan-sion or to the diffusien, say, of a perfume in the unresisting atmo-sphere. It is a penetrating infection which does not make itselfnoticeable beforehand as something opposed to the indifferentelement into which it insinuates itself, and therefore cannot bewarded off. Only when the infection has become widespreadis that consciousness, which unheedingly yielded to its influ-ence, aware ef it, For though the nature of what consciousnessreceived into itself was simple and homogeneous with it, yetit was also the simplicity of an introreflected negativity whichsubsequently also develops, in keeping with its nature, intosomething opposed to it and thereby reminds consciousness ofits previous state. This simplicity is the Notion, which is thesimple knowing that knows itself and also its opposite, butknows this opposite to be reduced to a moment within it. Con-sequently, when consciousness does become aware of pure in-sight, the latter is already widespread; the struggle against itbetrays the fact that infection has occurred. The struggle is toolate, and every remedy adopted only aggravates the disease,for it has laid hold of the marrow of spiritual life, viz. the Notion a C. (BB.) SPIRIT of consciousness, or the pure essence itself of consciousness.Therefore, too, there is no power in consciousness which couldovercome the disease. Because this is present in the essence itself,its manifestations, while still isolated, can be suppressed andthe superficial symptoms smothered. This is greatly to its ad-vantage, for it does not now squander its power or show itselfunworthy of its real nature, which is the case when it breaksout in symptoms and single eruptions antagonistic to the con-tent of faith and to its connection with the reality of the worldoutside of it.

As insight,therefore, it becomes the negative of pure insight, becomes un-truth and unreason, and, as intention, it becomes the negativeof pure intention, becomes a lie and insincerity of purpose.1Diderot’s Nephew of Rameau.

It only imagines this, for its essence asabsolute negativity implies that it contains that othernesswithin itself. The absolute Notion is the category; in thatNotion, knowing and the odject known are the same. Con-sequently, what pure insight pronounces to be its other, whatit asserts to be anerroror a lie, can be nothing else but its ownself; it can condemn only what it is itself. What is not rationalhas no truth, or, what is not grasped conceptually, ¿s not. When,therefore, Reason speaks of something other than itself, it speaksin fact only of itself; so doing, it does not go outside of itself.This struggle with its antithesis, therefore, also has the signifi-cance of being the actualization of insight. For this consists pre-cisely in the process of developing the moments and taking themback into itself. One part of this process is the differentiationin which intellectual insight confronts its own self as object; solong as it persists in this relationship it is alienated from itself.As pure insight it is devoid of all content; the process of its realiza-tion consists in its making ztself its content ; for nothing else canbecome its content because it is the self-consciousness of thecategory. But since in confronting the content, pure insight atfirst knows it only as a content and not yet as its own self, it doesnot recognize itself in it. Complete insight is therefore attainedwhen the content, which to begin with was objective to it, isrecognized as its own. Its result, however, will thus be neitherthe re-establishment of the errors it struggles against, normerely its original Notion, but an insight which recognizes theabsolute negation of itself to be its own actual existence, to beits own self, or an insight whose Notion recognizes its own self.This nature of the struggle of the Enlightenment with errors,that of fighting itself in them, and of condemning in them whatit itself asserts, is explicit for us, or what Enlightenment and itsstruggle is zn itself. It is the first aspect of this struggle, however,the defilement of Enlightenment through the adoption by itsself-identical purity of a negative attitude, that is an object forfaith, which therefore comes to know it as falsehood, unreason,and as ill-intentioned, just as Enlightenment regards faith aserror and prejudice. As regards its content, it is in the first in-stance an empty insight whose content appears to it to be some- 334 C. (BB.) SPIRIT thing other than itself; consequently, it finds it given in the shapeof a content which is not yet its own, as something that existsquite independently of it, finds it given in faith."},{"number":549,"text":"The way, therefore, in which Enlightenment appre-hends its object in the first instance and generally, is that it takesit as pure insight, and, not recognizing itself therein, declares itto be error. In insight as such, consciousness apprehends anobject in such a way that it becomes the essence of conscious-ness, or becomes an object which consciousness permeates, inwhich consciousness preserves itself, abides with itself, andremains present to itself, and since it is thus the movement ofthe object, brings it into existence. It is just this that Enlighten-ment rightly declares faith to be, when it says that what isfor faith the absolute Being, is a Being of its own consciousness,is its own thought, something that is a creation of consciousnessitself. Thus what Enlightenment declares to be an error anda fiction is the very same thing as Enlightenment itself is.Enlightenment that wants to teach faith the new wisdom doesnot tell it anything new; for its object is also for it just this,viz. a pure essence of its own consciousness, so that this con-sciousness does not take itself to be lost and negated in thatobject, but rather puts its trust in it, ie. it finds itself as thisparticular consciousness, or as self-consciousness, precisely in theobject. Whomsoever I trust, his certainty of himself is for me thecertainty of myself; I recognize in him my own being-for-self,know that he acknowledges it and that it is for him purposeand essence. Trust, however, is faith, because the consciousnessof the believer is directly related to its object and is thus also in-tuitively aware that it is one with it and in it. Further, sincewhat is object for me is that in which I recognize myself, I amfor myself at the same time in that object in the form of anotherself-consciousness, i.e. one which has become in that objectalienated from its particular individuality, viz. from its naturaland contingent existence, but which partly remains therein self-consciousness, partly, in that object, is an essential consciousnessjust as pure insight is. The Notion of pure insight implies notmerely that consciousness recognizes itself in the object of itsinsight and is immediately present in it without first leaving theelement of thought and returning into itself; it also implies thatconsciousness is aware of itselfas being also the mediating move- CULTURE 335 ment, aware of itself as being the activity of producing theobject. This unity of itself as unity of self and object is therebyexplicit for it in thought. Faith, too, is just this consciousness.Obedience and action form a necessary moment, throughwhich the certainty that absolute Being is comes about. Thisaction of faith does not indeed make it appear as if absoluteBeing itself is produced by it. But the absolute Being of faithis essentially not the abstract essence that would exist beyondthe consciousness of the believer ; on the contrary, it is the Spiritof the [religious] community, the unity of the abstract essenceand self-consciousness. That it be the Spirit of the community,this requires as a necessary moment the action of the com-munity. It is this Spirit, only by being produced by consciousness ;or rather, it does not exist as the Spirit of the community withouthaving been produced by consciousness. For essential as is theproducing of it, this is equally essentially not the sole groundof absolute Being, but only a moment. Absolute Being is at thesame time in and for itself."},{"number":550,"text":"On the other side, the Notion of pure insight is some-thing other to itself than its own object; for it is just this negativedetermination that constitutes the object. Thus, from the otherside, it also declares the essence of faith to be something aliento consciousness, to be not its essence but a changeling foistedon it. But here Enlightenment is foolish; faith regards it as notknowing what it is saying, and as not understanding the realfacts when it talks about priestly deception and deluding thepeople. It talks about this as if by some hocus-pocus of conjuringpriests consciousness had been palmed off with something abso-lutely alien and ‘other’ to it in place of its own essence; and atthe same time it says that this is an essence of consciousness,that consciousness believes in it, puts its trust in it, and seeks tomake it favourably disposed towards itself, i.e. consciousnessbeholds in it its pure essence just as much as its own single anduniversal individuality, and through this action produces thisunity of itself with its essence. Thus what it asserts to be aliento consciousness, it directly declares to be the inmost nature ofconsciousness itself. How then can it possibly talk about deceptionand delusion? Since, in the same voice, it asserts the very oppo-site of what it maintains regarding faith, it really reveals itselfto faith as the conscious lie. How are delusion and deception 336 C. (BB.) SPIRIT to take place where consciousness in its truth has directly thecertainty of itself, where in its object it possesses its own self, sinceit just as much finds as produces itself in it? The distinctionno longer exists even in words.

It condemns this picture-thought, and in it its ownobject. But in apprehending the object of faith as insight’s ownobject, it already does faith a wrong. For it is saying that theabsolute Being of faith is a piece of stone, a block of wood, whichhas eyes and sees not, or again, a piece of dough which, havingcome from the field is transformed by man and returned toearth again; or in whatever other ways faith anthropomor-phizes absolute Being, making it into an object that it canrepresent to itself. 553- Enlightenment, which professes to be pure, here con-verts what is for Spirit eternal life and Holy Spirit into anactual, perishable thing, and defiles it with sense-certainty’s viewof it, a viewpoint which is essentially trivial and definitelyabsent from faith in its worship, so that Enlightenment is com-pletely in the wrong when it imputes this view to faith. Whatfaith reveres, it certainly does not regard as stone or wood ordough, nor any other kind of temporal, sensuous thing. IfEnlightenment has a mind to say that, all the same, its objectis also this, or even that it is essentially and in truth this, thenfirstly, faith is equally well aware of that ‘also’ which, however,lies outside of its worship; secondly, however, faith does notregard such things as stones, etc. as possessing intrinsic being;on the contrary, what has intrinsic being for faith is solely theessential being of pure thought."},{"number":554,"text":"Thesecond moment is the relation of faith to this abso-lute Being as a consciousness that knows it. For faith, as a think-ing, pure consciousness, this Being is immediately present; butpure consciousness is just as much a mediated relation of certaintyto truth, a relation which constitutes the ground of faith. ForEnlightenment, this ground becomes equally a fortuitous know-ledge of fortuitous events. But the ground of knowledge is the con-scious universal, and in its truth is absolute Spirit which, inabstract pure consciousness, or in thought as such, is merelyabsolute Being, but, qua self-consciousness, is knowledge of itself.Pure insight characterizes this conscious universal, the simple,self-knowing Spirit, equally as a negative of self-consciousness. Itis true that pure insight is itself pure mediated, i.e. self-mediatedthought, is a pure knowing; but since it is a pure insight, a pureknowing, that does not as yet know itself, i.e. is not aware thatit ¿s this pure, mediating movement, the mediation seems to 338 C. (BB.) SPIRIT insight, as does everything that is itself insight, to be an ‘other’.In its realization, therefore, it develops this moment which isessential to it; but this moment seems to it to belong to faithand to have the character of something external to pure insight,to be a fortuitous knowledge of narratives of real events, realin the ordinary sense of the word. Here, therefore, it falselycharges religious belief with basing its certainty on some particu-lar historical evidences which, considered as historical evidences,would certainly not guarantee the degree of certainty abouttheir content which is given by newspaper accounts of anyhappening—further, that its certainty rests on the accidentalpreservation of these evidences; on the one hand, the preservationby means of paper, and on the other hand, by the skill andhonesty of their transference from one piece of paper to another,and lastly, on the correct interpretation of the meaning of deadwords and letters. In fact, however, it does not occur to faithto fasten its certainty to such evidences and such fortuitous cir-cumstances. Faith, in its certainty, is an unsophisticated rela-tionship to its absolute object, a pure knowing of it which doesnot mix up letters, paper, and copyists in its consciousness ofabsolute Being, and does not bring itself into relation with itby means of things of that kind. On the contrary, this conscious-ness is the self-mediating ground of its knowledge; it is Spirititself which bears witness to itself, both in the inwardness of theindividual consciousness and through the universal presence ineveryone of faith in it. If faith wants to appeal to historicalevidences in order to get that kind of foundation, or at leastconfirmation, of its content that Enlightenment talks about,and seriously thinks and acts as if that were a matter of im-portance, then it has already let itself be corrupted by theEnlightenment; and its efforts to establish and consolidateitself in such a way are merely evidence it gives of its corrup-tion by the Enlightenment."},{"number":555,"text":"There still remains the third side, the relation to absoluteBeing of consciousness as action. This action is the setting-aside ofthe particularity of the individual, or of the natural mode ofits being-for-self, whence proceeds its certainty of being pureself-consciousness, of being, in accordance with its action, i.e.as an independent individual, one with absolute Being. Since, inaction, purposiveness and Endare distinguished, and pure insight CULTURE 339 in relation to this action equally adopts a negative attitude and,as in the other moments, denies its own self, it must, as regardspur posiveness, exhibit itself as lacking in intelligence, since insightunited with intention, i.e. the harmony of End and Means,appears to it as an ‘other’, or rather as the opposite of insight;as regards the End itself, however, it has to make badness,enjoyment, and possession its End and so prove itself to be theimpurest kind of intention, since pure intention, qua ‘other’, isequally impure intention."},{"number":556,"text":"Accordingly, we see that as regards purposiveness,Enlightenment finds it foolish when the believer gives himselfthe superior consciousness of not being in bondage to naturalenjoyment and pleasure by actually denying himself naturalenjoymentand pleasure, anddemonstrating by his actions that hiscontempt for them is no lie but is genuine. Similarly, Enlighten-ment finds it foolish that the individual absolves itself of itsquality of being absolutely individual, excluding all others andof possessing property. ofits own , by itself giving up its property ;for thereby it shows in truth that it is not in earnest with thisisolation of itself, but is raised above the natural necessity ofisolating itself, and in this absolute isolation of being-for-selfdenying that others are the same as itself. Pure insight finds bothto be of no purpose as well as wrong: the purpose of showingoneself to be free of pleasure and possession is not served bydenying oneself pleasure and giving away a possession; in theopposite case, therefore, it will declare the man a fool who, inorder to eat, has recourse to actually eating. Insight also findsit wrong to deny oneself a meal and to give away butter andeggs, not for money, nor money for butter and eggs, but simplyto give them away without receiving anything in return; it de-clares a meal or the possession of things of that sort to be anEnd in itself, and hence in fact declares itself to be a very impureintention, which treats such enjoyment and possession as some-thing wholly essential. Again, it also affirms as a pure intentionthe necessity of rising above natural existence, above acquisi-tiveness about the means of existence; only it finds it foolishand wrong that this elevation should be demonstrated by deeds ;in other words, this pure insight is in truth a deception, whichfeigns and demands an inner elevation, but declares that it issuperfluous, foolish, and even wrong to be in earnest about it, 340 C. (BB.)

It presents itself in this bad light because, just by beingin relation to an ‘other’, it gives itselfia negative reality, or exhibitsitselfas the opposite of itself; but pure insight and intention mustenter into this relationship, for it is their realization. This atfirst appeared as a negative reality. Perhaps its positive realityis better constituted. Let us see how things stand with this. Ifall prejudice and superstition have been banished, the questionarises, What next? What is the truth Enlightenment has propagatedin their stead? It has already declared that this positive contentis in its extirpation of error, for that alienation of itself is justas much its positive reality. In its approach to what, for faith,is absolute Spirit, itinterprets any determinateness it discovers thereas wood, stone, etc., as particular, real things. Since in this wayit grasps in general every determinateness, i.e. all content andfilling, as something finite, as a human entity and [mere] idea, abso-lute Being becomes for it a vacuum to which no determinations,no predicates, can be attributed. The attribution of predicatesto such a vacuum would be in itself reprehensible ; and it is justin such a union that the monstrosities of superstition have beenproduced. Reason, pure insight, is certainly not empty itself, sincethe negative of itself is for it, and is its content; on the contrary,it is rich, but rich only in particularity and limitations. To letnothing of that sort appertain to absolute Being or be attributedto it, this is the prudent behaviour of Reason, of pure insight,which knows how to put itselfand its finite riches in their properplace, and how to deal with the Absolute in a worthy manner."},{"number":558,"text":"In contrast to this empty Being there stands, as thesecond moment of the positive truth of Enlightenment, thesingleness in general of consciousness and ofall being, a singlenessexcluded from absolute Being and in the form of absolute being-in-and-for-itself. Consciousness, which in its very first reality issense-certainty and mere ‘meaning’, returns here to this fromthe whole course of its experience and is again a knowledge ofwhat is purely negative of itself, or of things of sense, i.e. of things CULTURE 341 which immediately and indifferently confront its being-for-self.Here, however, it is not an immediate, natural consciousness; onthe contrary, it has become such for itself. Whereas at first it wasat the mercy of every sort of entanglement into which it wasplunged by its unfolding, and now has been led back by pureinsight to its first shape, it has experienced that shape as result.Being based on the nothingness of all the other shapes of con-sciousness, and hence of everything beyond sense-certainty, thissense-certainty is no longer mere ‘meaning’, but rather absolutetruth. This nothingness of everything that lies beyond sense-certainty is no doubt merely a negative proof of this truth; butit is not susceptible ofany other. For the positive truth of sense-certainty is in its own self the immediate being-for-self of theNotion itself qua object, and that too in the form of otherness—the positive truth that every consciousness is absolutely certainthat it is, and that there are other real things outside of it, andthat in its natural being it, like these things, is in and for itselfor absolute."},{"number":559,"text":"Lastly, the third moment of the truth of Enlightenment isthe relation of the individual being to absolute Being, is therelation between the first two moments. Insight, gua pure in-sight of what is identical or unrestricted, also goes beyond what isnot identical, viz. beyond finite reality, or beyond itself as mereotherness. For the beyond of this otherness it has the vod towhich, therefore, it relates the sensuous reality. In the determi-nation of this relation, both of the sides do not enter as content;for one of them is the void, and it is only through the other,the sensuous reality, that a content is present. But the form ofthe relation, to the determination of which the side of the in-itself contributes, can be a matter of choice; for the form is some-thing intrinsically negative, and therefore self-opposed: being aswell as nothing, the in-self as well as its opposite; or, what is thesame thing, the relation of the actual world to the in-itself quaa beyond, is as much a negating as a positing of that actual world.Finite reality can therefore, properly speaking, be taken justas one needs. The sensuous is therefore now related positivelyto the Absolute as to the in-itself, and sensuous reality is itselfan intrinsic being; the Absolute makes it, fosters and cherishesit. Then, again, it is related to the Absolute as an opposite, asto its own non-being; in this relationship it is not anything in 342 C. (BB.) SPIRIT itself, but exists only for an ‘other’. Whereas in the precedingshape of consciousness, the Notions of the antithesis were deter-mined as Good and Bad, in the case of pure insight, on the otherhand, they become the purer abstractions of being-in-itself andbeing-for-another."},{"number":560,"text":"Both ways of viewing the positive and the negative rela-tions of the finite to the in-itself are, however, in fact equallynecessary, and everything is thus as much something in itselfas it is for an ‘other’; in other words, everything is useful.

From this, we see what is theessence and what is the place of man regarded as a Thing thatis conscious of this relation. As he immediately is, as a naturalconsciousness per se, man is good, as an individual he is absoluteand all else exists for him; and moreover, since the momentshave for him, qua self-conscious animal, the significance of uni-versality, everything exists for his pleasure and delight and, asone who has come from the hand of God, he walks the earthas in a garden planted for him. He must also have plucked thefruit of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil. He possessesin this an advantage which distinguishes him from all othercreatures, for it happens that his intrinsically good nature isalso so constituted that an excess of pleasure does it harm, orrather his individuality has also its beyond within it, can gobeyond itself and destroy itself. To counter this, Reason is forhim a useful instrument for keeping this excess within bounds,or rather for preserving himself when he oversteps his limit; forthis is the power of consciousness. Enjoyment on the part ofthe conscious, intrinsically universal being, must not itself besomething determinate as regards variety and duration, butuniversal. ‘Measure’ or proportion has therefore the functionof preventing pleasure in its variety and duration from beingcut short; i.e. the function of ‘measure’ is immoderation. Justas everything is useful to man, so man is useful too, and hisvocation is to make himself a member of the group, of use forthe common good and serviceable to all.

To faith, it seems to be a perversion anda lie because it points out the otherness of its moments; in doingso, it seems directly to make something else out of them thanthey are in their separateness ; but this ‘other’ is equally essentialand, in truth, is present in the believing consciousness itself, onlythis does not think about it, but puts it away somewhere. Con-sequently, it is neither alien to faith, nor can faith disavow it."},{"number":565,"text":"Enlightenment itself, however, which reminds faith ofthe opposite aspect of its separated moments, is just as little en-lightened about itself. It has a purely negative attitude to faithso far as it excludes its own content from its purity and takesthat content to be the ne gative of itself. It therefore neither recog-nizes itself in this negative, in the content of faith, nor for thisreason does it bring the two thoughts together, the one whichit puts forward itself, and the one to which it opposes the first.Since it does not recognize that what it condemns in faith isdirectly its own thought, it is itself in the antithesis of the twomoments, only one of which—viz. in every case the one opposedto faith—it acknowledges, but separates the other from the first,just as faith does. Consequently, Enlightenment does not pro-duce the unity of both as their unity, i.e. the Notion; but theNotion comes into being for it of its own accord, in other words, CULTURE 345 Enlightenment finds the Notion there merely as something given.For, in itself, the realization of pure insight is just this, that in-sight, whose essence is the Notion, at first becomes for itself anabsolute ‘other’ and repudiates itself—for the antithesis of theNotion is an absolute antithesis—and then out of this othernessit comes to itself, or to its Notion. But Enlightenment is onlythis movement, it is the still unconscious activity of the pureNotion, an activity which, though it does arrive at its object,takes it to be an other, and, too, does not know the nature of theNotion, viz. that it is the undifferentiated which absolutelysunders itself. As against faith, then, insight is the might of theNotion in so far as it is the movement and the relating of themoments lying asunder in its consciousness, a relating in whichtheir contradiction comes to light. Herein lies the absolute rightoftheauthority which insight exercises over faith ; but the realityon which it exercises this authority lies just in the fact that thebelieving consciousness is itself the Notion, and therefore itselfacknowledges the opposite [aspect] which insight puts beforeit. Insight therefore retains its right as against faith because itmakes valid in faith what is necessary to faith itself and whatfaith possesses in itself."},{"number":566,"text":"At first, Enlightenment affirms this moment of theNotion, that it is an act of consciousness ; opposing faith, it main-tains that the absolute Being of faith is a Being of the believer’sown consciousness qua a self, or that this absolute Being is aproduct of consciousness. To faith, its absolute Being, while itis possessed of intrinsic being for the believer, is also at the sametime not like an alien thing which is just found in him, no oneknowing how and whence it came. On the contrary, the faithof the believer consists just in his finding himself as this particularpersonal consciousness in the absolute Being, and his obedienceand service consist in producing, through his own activity, thatBeing as his own absolute Being. Enlightenment, strictly speak-ing, only reminds faith of this, if faith roundly asserts that thein-itself of absolute Being is beyond the activity of consciousness.But while Enlightenment, it is true, corrects the one-sidednessof faith by bringing to its notice the opposite moment of actionin contrast to being—and it is being which faith is alone thinkingof here—and yet does not itself bring its own thoughts together,it isolates the pure moment of action and asserts that the in-itself 346 C. (BB.) SPIRIT of faith is only a product of consciousness. This action, taken inisolation and opposed to the in-itself, is, however, a contingentaction and, qua an activity of picture-thinking, is a creating offictions—picture-thoughts which possess no intrinsic being; andthis is how Enlightenment regards the content of faith. But,conversely, pure insight equally says the reverse. In maintain-ing the moment of utherness which the Notion has within it, itpronounces [absolute] Being to be for faith something whichin no way concerns consciousness, lies beyond it, is alien to itand unknown. The case is similar with faith. On the one hand, it puts its trust in absolute Being, and in doing so obtains thecertainty of itself; on the other hand, for faith, absolute Beingis unsearchable in all its ways and in its Being unattainable."},{"number":567,"text":"Further, Enlightenment maintains against the believera right which the latter himself concedes, when Enlightenmentregards the object of the believer’s veneration as stone andwood, or else as something finite and anthropomorphic. Forsince this consciousness is divided within itself, having a beyondof the real world and a world that is altogether this side of theworld beyond, there is, as a matter of fact, also present in it thisview of the thing ofsense according to which it counts as a beingthat is in and for itself; but faith does not bring together thesetwo thoughts of absolute Being, which is for it at one time pureessence and at another time an ordinary thing of sense. Even itspure consciousness is affected by the latter view; for the dif-ferences of the supersensible world, because this is without theNotion, are aseries of independent shapes and their movementis a happening, i.e. they exist only in picture-thinking and havewithin them the marks of sensuous existence. Enlightenment,on its side, equally isolates the actual world as an entity for-saken by Spirit, isolates determinateness as unmoved fini-tude, as if it were not even a moment in the spiritual movementof essential being, not nothing, but also not something thatabsolutely zs, but something that is evanescent."},{"number":568,"text":"It is clear that the same is the case with the ground ofknowledge. Faith itself acknowledges a contingent knowledge;for it has a relationship to contingent things, and absolute Beingitself exists for faith in the form of a pictorial representationof a common reality. Consequently, the believing conscious-ness, too, is a certainty which does not possess the truth within CULTURE 347 itself, and it confesses itself to be such an unessential conscious-ness, to be of this world and separated from the Spirit that iscertain of itself and self-authenticated. But it forgets thismoment in its immediate spiritual knowledge of absolute Being.Enlightenment, however, which reminds it of this, in its turnthinks only of contingent being and forgets the other—thinksonly of the mediation which takes place through an alien thirdterm, not of the mediation in which the immediate is itself thethird term through which it mediates itself with the other, viz.with its own self."},{"number":569,"text":"Finally, Enlightenment in its view of the action of faithfinds the rejection ofenjoyment and possessions wrong and pur-poseless. As to the rejection being wrong, Enlightenment is inagreement with faith on this point; for faith itself acknowledgesthis reality of possessing, holding on to, and enjoying, property.In holding on to property its behaviour is all the more self-centred and stubborn, and in its enjoyment it is all the morecrudely self-abandoned, since its religious act of giving up posses-sions and enjoyment falls on the far side of this reality and pur-chases freedom for itself on that side. This service of sacrificeof natural impulses and enjoyments has, in fact, owing to thisaatithesis, no truth. Retention occurs along with sacrifice; thelatter is merely a symbol which performs real sacrifice on onlya small portion, and is therefore in point of fact only a sacrificein imagination."},{"number":570,"text":"As regards purposiveness, Enlightenment finds it inept tothrow away one possession in order to know and to prove thatone is liberated from all possessions, to deny oneself oneenjoyment in order to know and to prove that one is liberatedfrom all enjoyment. Faith itselfapprehends the absolute actionas a universal action; not only is the action of its absolute Beingas its object a universal action for faith, but the individual con-sciousness, too, has to show that it is liberated entirely andgenerally from its sensual nature. But throwing away a singlepossession, or renouncing a single enjoyment, is not this uni-versal action; and since in the action the purpose, which is auniversal purpose, and the performance, which is a single per-formance, would be bound to present themselves to conscious-ness as essentially incompatible, that action shows itself to beone in which consciousness has no part, and thus this kind of 348 C. (BB.) SPIRIT action is seen to be really too naive to be an action at all. Itis too naive to fast, in order to prove that one is liberated fromthe pleasures of the table; too naive to rid the body of anotherpleasure, as Origen did, in order to show that that pleasure isfinished and done with. The action itself proves to be an externaland single operation; but desire is rooted inwardly and is a uni-versal. Its pleasure disappears neither with the instrument norby abstention from particular pleasures."},{"number":571,"text":"But Enlightenment on its side here isolates the inward,the unreal, as opposed to reality, just as it held fast to the exter-nality of the Thing as opposed to the inwardness of faith in thelatter’s contemplation and devotion. It places the essential fac-tor in the intention, in the thought, and thereby saves itself thetrouble of actually accomplishing the liberation from naturalaims. On the contrary, this inwardness is itself the formal ele-ment which has its filling in the natural impulses, which arejustified simply by the fact that they are inward, that theybelong to universal being, to Nature."},{"number":572,"text":"Enlightenment, then, holds an irresistible authorityover faith because, in the believer’s own consciousness, arefound the very moments which Enlightenment has establishedas valid. Examining the effect of this authority more closely,its behaviour towards faith seems to rend asunder the beautifulunity of trust and immediate certainty, to pollute its spiritual con-sciousness with mean thoughts of sensuous reality, to destroy thesoul which is composed and secure in its submission, by the vanityof the Understanding and of self-will and self-fulfilment. Butas a matter of fact, the result of the Enlightenment is ratherto doaway with the thoughtless, or rather non-notional, separationwhich is present in faith. The believing consciousness weighsand measures by a twofold standard; it has two sorts ofeyes, two sorts of ears, speaks with two voices, has duplicatedall ideas without comparing the twofold meanings. In otherwords, faith lives in two sorts of non-notional perceptions, theone the perceptions of the slumbering consciousness which livespurely in non-notional thoughts, the other those of the wakingconsciousness which lives solely in the world of sense; and ineach of them it has its own separate housekeeping. Theenlightenment illuminates that heavenly world with ideasbelongingto theworldofsense, and points out this finitude which CULTURE 349 faith cannot deny, because it is self-consciousness and hence isthe unity to which both kinds of ideas belong and in which theydo not fall apart; for they belong to the same indivisible unitaryself into which faith has passed."},{"number":573,"text":"As a result, faith has lost the content which filled itselement, and collapses into a state in which it moves listlesslyto and fro within itself. It has been expelled from its kingdom;or, this kingdom has been ransacked, since the waking con-sciousness has monopolized every distinction and expansion ofit and has vindicated earth’s ownership of every portion ofit and given them back to earth. Yet faith is not on that accountsatisfied, for this illumination has everywhere brought to lightonly single, separate entities, so that what speaks to Spirit isonly a reality without any substance, and a finitude forsakenby Spirit. Since faith is without any content and it cannotremain in this void, or since, in going beyond the finite whichis the sole content, it finds only the void, it is a sheer yearning,its truth an empty beyond, for which a fitting content can nolonger be found, for everything is bestowed elsewhere. Faithhas, in fact, become the same as Enlightenment, viz. the con-sciousness of the relation of what is in itself finite to an Absolutewithout predicates, an Absolute unknown and unknowable;but there is this difference, the latter is satisfied Enlightenment,but faith is unsatisfied Enlightenment. However, we shall seewhether Enlightenment can remain satisfied; that yearning ofthe troubled Spirit which mourns over the loss of its spiritualworld lurks in the background. Enlightenment itself bearswithin it this blemish of an unsatisfied yearning: as pure object,in its empty absolute Being; as action and movement, in going beyondits individual self to an empty and unfulfilled beyond; as anobject with a content, in the lack of selfhood in the thing that is‘useful’. Enlightenment will rid itself of this blemish; a closerexamination of the positive result which is its truth will showthat in that result the blemish is in principle already removed. b. The truth of Enlightenment"},{"number":574,"text":"The listless movement of Spirit which no longer createsa distinction within itself has thus entered into its own selfbeyond consciousness, which, on the other hand, sees itselfclearly. The first moment of this clarity is determined in its 350 C. (BB.) SPIRIT necessity and condition by the fact that pure insight, or insightthat is implicitly Notion, actualizes itself; it does so when it positsotherness or determinateness within itself. In this way it isnegative pure insight, i.e. a negation of the Notion; thisnegation is equally pure; and thus there has come into beingthe pure Thing, the absolute Being, that has no furtherdetermination whatever. Characterized more precisely, pureinsight, gua absolute Notion, is a distinguishing of differenceswhich are no longer differences, of abstractions or pure Notionswhich are no longer self-supporting, but are supported anddistinguished only by the movement as a whole. This distinguishingof what contains no difference consists simply in the fact thatthe absolute Notion makes itself into its object and posits itselfas the essence over against that movement. This results in theessence being without that side wherein abstractions ordifferences are held apart, and therefore becomes pure thought inthe form of a pure Thing. This, then, is just the listless,unconscious movement to and fro within itself of Spirit to whichfaith was reduced when it lost a content that contained adifference; it is at the same time that movement of pure self-consciousness for which the essence is supposed to be theabsolutely alien beyond. For because this pure self-consciousness moves about in pure Notions, in differences thatare not differences, it collapses in fact into the unconsciousmovement to and fro of Spirit, i.e. into pure feeling, or purethinghood. The self-alienated Notion—for the Notion here is stillstanding at the stage of this alienation—does not, however,recognize this identical essence of the two sides—the movementof self-consciousness and of its absolute Being-—does notrecognize their identical essence which is, in fact, their substanceand enduring being. Since the Notion is unconscious of thisunity, absolute Being has value for it only in the form of abeyond standing over against it, while the consciousness makingthese distinctiions and in this way having the in-itself outsideof it, is held to be a finite consciousness."},{"number":575,"text":"In regard to that absolute Being, Enlightenment iscaught up in the same internal conflict that it formerlyexperienced in connection with faith, and it divides itself intotwo parties.

The inter-est which was divided between itself and the other party nowfalls entirely within itself, and the other party is forgotten,because that interest finds within itself the antithesis whichoccupies its attention. At the same time, however, it has beenraised into the higher victorious element in which it exhibitsitself in a clarified form. So that the schism that arises in oneof the parties and seems to be a misfortune, demonstrates ratherthat party’s good fortune."},{"number":576,"text":"The pure essence itself has no difference in it; con-sequently, the way in which it does obtain a difference is thattwo such pure essences exhibit themselves for consciousness, orthere is a twofold consciousness of the essence.

But in this way, it is just[mere] being, the negative of self-consciousness. As the negativeof self-consciousness it is also related to it; it is an external beingwhich, related to self-consciousness within which differencesand determination fall, receives within it the differences ofbeing tasted, seen, etc. ; and the relationship is that of sense-cer-tainty and perception. 577- Ifwestart from this sensuous being into which that nega-tive beyond necessarily passes, but abstract from these specificways in which consciousness is related to it, then what remainsis pure matter as a listless, aimless movement to and fro withinitself. In this connection, it is important to bear in mind thatpure matter is merely what is leftover when we abstract from seeing,feeling, tasting, etc., i.e. itis not matter that is seen, tasted, felt,etc. ; what is seen, felt, tasted, is not matter, but colour, a stone,a salt, etc. Matter is rather a pure abstraction; and so what weare presented with here is the pure essence of thought, or purethought itself as the Absolute, which contains no differences,is indeterminate and devoid of predicates."},{"number":578,"text":"One party of the Enlightenment calls absolute Beingthat predicateless Absolute which exists in thought beyond theactual consciousness which formed the starting-point; theother calls it matter. If these were to be distinguished as Natureand Spirit, or God, then the unconscious and aimless inner 352 C. (BB.) SPIRIT movement to and fro would lack the wealth of developed lifewhich would make it Nature, and the self-differentiated con-sciousness which would make it Spirit or God. The two, as wesaw, are absolutely the same Notion; the difference lies not inwhat they actually are, but simply and solely in the differentstarting-points of the two developments, and in the fact thateach sticks to its own point in the movement of thought. If theycould disregard their own starting-points they would meet andwould recognize that what to the one is, so it pretends, anabomination, and to the other, a folly, is the same thing. Forto the one, absolute Being is in its pure thinking, or is imme-diately for pure consciousness, is outside finite consciousness,the negative beyond of it. If it would reflect, firstly, that thesimple immediacy of thought is nothing else but pure being, andsecondly, that what is negative for consciousness is at the sametime related to it, that in the negative judgement the ‘is’(copula) holds together as well as separates the terms, it wouldcome to see that this beyond, characterized as something exist-ing externally, stands in a relation to consciousness and is thusthe same as what is called pure matter: the missing moment ofpresence would be gained. The other Enlightenment starts fromsensuous being, then abstracts from the sensuous relation of tast-ing, seeing, etc., and makes that being into a pure in-itself, intoan absolute matter, into what is neither felt nor tasted. This beinghas in this way become something simple without predicates,the essence of pure consciousness; it is the pure Notion as implicitlyexistent, or pure thought within itself. This insight does not con-sciously take the reverse step from what is, what simply is, to whatis thought, which is the same as what simply is, does not takethe step from the pure positive to the pure negative; although,after all, the positive is pure solely through negation, while thepure negative, as pure, is in its own self self-identical and justfor that reason positive. Or again, they have not arrived at theNotion found in Descartes’s metaphysics, that being andthought are, in themselves, the same; they have not arrived atthe thought that being, pure being, is not something concretelyreal but a pure abstraction, and conversely, pure thought, self-identity or essence, partly is the negative of self-consciousness andtherefore being, partly, as immediately simple, is likewise noth-ing else but being; thought is thinghood, or thinghood is thought. CULTURE 353 579- Essence, here, is split into two in such a way that, tobegin with, two different ways of considering it are involved.In part, essence must contain difference within itself; in part,just because of this, the two ways of considering it merge intoone; for the abstract moments of pure being and the negative,by which they are distinguished, are then united in the objectso considered. The universal common to both is the abstractionof a pure, inward oscillation, or of pure self-thinking. Thissimple rotatory motion must become more complex because itis itself only motion by distinguishing its moments. This distin-guishing of the moments leaves their unmoved [unity] behindas the empty husk of pure being, which is no longer actualthought, no longer has any life within it; for this process of dif-ferentiation is, qua difference, all the content. This process, how-ever, which places itself outside of that unity, is an alternation—an alternation which does not return into itself, of being -for-an-other,and of being-for-self; it is reality in the way this is an objectfor the actual consciousness of pure insight—Utility."},{"number":580,"text":"Bad as Utility may look to faith or sentimentality, oreven to the abstract thought that calls itself speculation, whichclings to the in-ztself, yet itis in Utility that pure insight achievesits realization and has itself for its object, an object which it nowno longer repudiates and which, too, no longer has for it thevalue of the void or the pure beyond. For pure insight is, aswe saw, the existent Notion itself, or pure self-identical per-sonality distinguishing itself within itselfin such a way that eachof the distinguished moments is itself pure Notion, i.e. is at thesame time not distinguished ; pure insight is simple, pure self-consciousness which is foritselfas well asinitselfin an immediateunity. Its being-in-itself is therefore not an enduring being, butin its difference immediately ceases to be something; such abeing, however, that is immediately without support is not anintrinsic being, but is essentially for an other which is the powerthat absorbs it. But this second moment which is opposed tothe first, to the being-in-ztself, equally vanishes immediately likethe first; or, as a being which is only for an other, it is ratherthe vanishing itself, and there is posited the accomplished returninto itself, being-for-self. This simple being-for-self, however, asself-identity, is rather a [mere] being, or is thereby for an other.This nature of pure insight in the unfolding of its moments, 354 C. (BB.) SPIRIT or insight qua object, is expressed in the Useful. What is useful,is something with an enduring being in itself, or a Thing; thisbeing-in-itself is at the same time only a pure moment; henceit is absolutely for an other, but equally is for an ‘other’ merelywhat it is in itself; these opposed moments have returned intothe indivisible unity of being-for-self. While the Useful doesexpress the Notion of pure insight, it is not pure insight as suchbut insight conceived by it in the form of object; it is merely therestless alternation of those moments, of which one indeed isitself the accomplished return into itself, but only as a being-for-self, i.e. as an abstract moment appearing on one side overagainst the others. The Useful itself is not a negative essence,having in itself these moments in their antithesis and, at thesame time as undivided in one and the same respect, or as thought,as they are qua pure insight; the moment of being-for-self is cer-tainly present in the Useful, but not in such a way that itoverarches the other moments, the in-itself and the being-for-another, in which case it would be the self. Pure insight has, there-fore, in the Useful its own Notion in its pure moments for object;it is the awareness of this metaphysics, but not as yet the compre-hension of it; consciousness has not yet reached the unity of Beingand Notion itself. Since the Useful still has the form of an objectfor pure insight, it does have a world, one which, it is true, isno longer in and for itself, but yet a world which it distinguishesfrom itself.

But returned into itself, that Notion is pure insight—pureconsciousness as pure self, or negativity, just as faith is preciselythe same as pure thought, or positivity. In that self, faith has themoment that makes it complete; but perishing through beingthus completed, it is in pure insight that we now see the twomoments: as absolute Being, which is simply thought or the nega-tive, and as matter, which has positive being. This completenessstill lacks that actual world of self-consciousness which belongs CULTURE 355 to the vain consciousness—the world out of which thought raiseditself to itself. What is thus lacking is obtained in Utility in sofar as pure insight there acquires positive objectivity; pure in-sight is thereby an actual consciousness satisfied within itself.This objectivity now constitutes its world; it has become thetruth of the entire preceding world, of the ideal, as well as ofthe real, world. The first world of Spirit is the widespread realmof its self-dispersed existence and of the self-certainty of its indivi-dual forms, just as Nature disperses its life into infinitely variousforms without the genus of those forms having an actual exist-ence. The second world contains the genus and is the realm ofintrinsic being or truth over against that certainty. The thirdworld, however, that of the Useful, is the ¢ruth which is equallythe certainty of itself. The realm of the truth of faith lacks theprinciple of actuality, or the certainty of self as this particularindividual. But the actuality or the certainty of self as this par-ticular individual lacks intrinsic being. In the object of pure in-sight both worlds are united. The Useful is the object in so faras self-consciousness penetrates it and has in it the certainty of itsindividual self, its enjoyment (its being-for-self) ; self-consciousnesssees right into the object, and this insight contains the trueessence of the object (which is to be something that is penetrated[by consciousness], or to be for an ‘other’). This insight is thus ‘itself a true knowing, and self-consciousness has equally directlythe universal certainty of itself, its pure consciousness, in this rela-‘tionship in which, therefore, truth as well as presence and actu-ality are united.

But thisindividual consciousness is no less directly conscious of itself asuniversal will; it is aware that its object is a law given by thatwill and a work accomplished by it; therefore, in passing overinto action and in creating objectivity, it is doing nothing in-dividual, but carrying out the laws and functions of the state."},{"number":588,"text":"This movement is thus the interaction of consciousnesswith itself in which it lets nothing break loose to become a freeobject standing over against it.

SPIRIT tration of self-consciousness and Substance—an interpenetra-tion in which self-consciousness, which has experienced thenegative power ofits universal essence acting on it, would desireto know and find itself, not as this particular individual, butonly as a universal, and therefore, too, would be able to endurethe objective reality of universal Spirit, a reality excluding self-consciousness qua particular. But in absolute freedom there wasno reciprocal action between a consciousness that is immersedin the complexities of existence, or that sets itself specific aimsand thoughts, and a valid external world, whether of reality orthought; instead, the world was absolutely in the form of con-sciousness as a universal will, and equally self-consciousness wasdrawn together out of the whole expanse of existence or mani-fested aims and judgements, and concentrated into the simpleself. The culture to which it attains in interaction with thatessence is, therefore, the grandest and the last, is that of seeingits pure, simple reality immediately vanish and pass away intoempty nothingness. In the world of culture itself it does not getas far as to behold its negation or alienation in this form of pureabstraction; on the contrary, its negation is filled with a con-tent, either honour or wealth, which it gains in place of theself that it has alienated from itself; or the language of Spiritand insight which the disrupted consciousness acquires; or itis the heaven of faith, or the Utility of the Enlightenment. Allthese determinations have vanished in the loss suffered by theselfin absolute freedom ; its negation is the death that is withoutmeaning, the sheer terror of the negative that contains nothingpositive, nothing that fills it with a content. At the same time,however, this negation in its real existence is not somethingalien; it is neither the universal inaccessible necessity in whichthe ethical world perishes, nor the particular accident of privatepossession, nor the whim of the owner on which the disruptedconsciousness sees itself dependent; on the contrary, it is theuniversal will which in this its ultimate abstraction has nothingpositive and therefore can give nothing in return for the sacri-fice. But for that very reason it is immediately one with self-consciousness, or it is the pure positive, because it is the purenegative ; and the meaningless death, the unfilled negativity ofthe self, changes round in its inner Notion into absolute posit-ivity. For consciousness, the immediate unity of itself with the CULTURE 363 universal will, its demand to know itself as this specific pointin the universal will, is changed round into the absolutely oppo-site experience. What vanishes for it in that experience isabstract being or the immediacy of that insubstantial point, andthis vanished immediacy is the universal will itself which it nowknows itself to be in so far as it is a pure knowing or pure will.Consequently, it knows that will to be itself, and knows itselfto be essential being; but not essential being as an immediateexistence, not will as revolutionary government or anarchy striv-ing to establish anarchy, nor itself as the centre of this factionor the opposite faction; on the contrary, the universal will is itspure knowing and willing and it is the universal will qua this pureknowing and willing. It does not lose itself in that will, for pureknowing and willing is much more it than is that atomic pointofconsciousness. It is thus the interaction of pure knowing withitself; pure knowing qua essential being is the universal will; butthis essential being is abolutely nothing else but pure knowing.Self-consciousness is, therefore, the pure knowing of essentialbeing qua pure knowing. Further, as an individual self, it is onlythe form of the subject or of real action, a form which is knownby it as form.

This, how-ever, means that enjoyment is also implied in morality as dis-position, for this does not remain disposition in contrast toaction, but proceeds to act or to realize itself.

Theexistence thus demanded, i.e. the unity of both, is therefore nota wish nor, regarded as purpose, one whose attainment werestill uncertain ; it is rather a demand of Reason, or an immediatecertainty and presupposition of Reason."},{"number":603,"text":"That first experience and this postulate are not the solepostulates, but a whole circle of postulates opens up. Nature,that is to say, is not merely this wholly free, external mode ofbeing in which, as a pure object, consciousness had to realizeits purpose. This consciousness is, in its own self, essentially oneJor which this other free actual existence is, i.e. it is itself a contin-gent and natural existence. This Nature, which is for conscious-ness its own nature, is sensuousness, which in the shape of voli-tion, as instincts and inclinations, possesses a specific essentialityofits own, or has its own individual purposes, and thus is opposedto the pure will and its pure purpose. However, in contrast withthis opposition, pure consciousness has rather the relation ofsensuousness to it, the absolute unity of the latter with it, forits essence. Both of these, pure thought and the sensuous aspectof consciousness, are in themselves a single consciousness, and it isprecisely pure thought for which and in which this pure unityis. But gua consciousness, what is explicit for it is the antithesisof itself and impulses and instincts. In this conflict betweenReason and sensuousness, the essential thing for Reason is that 368 C. (BB.) SPIRIT the conflict be resolved, the result being the emergence of theunity ofboth, a unity which is not the former original [i.e. imme-diate] unity of both in a single individual, but a unity whichproceeds from the known antithesis of both. Only such a unityis actual morality, for in it is contained the antithesis wherebythe self is consciousness, or first is an actual self in fact, andat the same time a universal. In other words, in that unity thereis expressed that mediation which, as we see, is essential tomorality. Since, of the two moments of the antithesis, sensuous-ness is sheer otherness, or the negative, while, on the other hand,the pure thought of duty is the essence, no element of whichcan be given up, it seems that the resultant unity can only bebrought about by getting rid of sensuousness. But since sen-suousness is itself a moment of the process producing the unity,viz. the moment of actuality, we have to be content, in the firstinstance, with expressing the unity by saying that sensuousnessshould be in conformity with morality. This unity is likewise apostulated being; it is not actually there; for what is there is con-sciousness, or the antithesis of sensuousness and pure conscious-ness. But at the same time, the unity is not an in-itself or merelyimplicit like the first postulate in which free Nature constitutesan element of the unity, and in consequence the harmony ofNature with the moral consciousness falls outside of the latter.On the contrary, Nature here is that which is an element ofconsciousness itself, and we have here to deal with morality assuch, with a morality that is the active self’s very own. Con-sciousness has, therefore, itself to bring about this harmony andcontinually to be making progress in morality. But the con-summation of this progress has to be projected into a futureinfinitely remote; for if it actually came about, this would doaway with the moral consciousness. For morality is only moralconsciousness as negative essence, for whose pure duty sensuous-ness has only a negative significance, is only not in conformitywith duty. But, in that harmony, morality qua consciousness, i.e.its actuality, vanishes, just as in the moral consciousness, or inthe actuality of morality, the harmony vanishes. The consumma-tion, therefore, cannot be attained, but is to be thought ofmerely as an absolute task, i.e. one which simply remains a task.Yet at the same time its content has to be thought of as some-thing which simply must be, and must not remain a task: MORALITY 369 whether we imagine the [moral] consciousness to be altogetherdone away with in this goal, or not. Which of these really isthe case can no longer clearly be determined in the dim remote-ness of infinity, to which for that very reason the attainmentof the goal is postponed. Strictly speaking, we shall have to saythat a definite idea on this point ought not to interest us, andought not to be looked for, because it leads to contradictions—the contradiction of a task which is to remain a task and yetought to be fulfilled, and the contradiction of a morality whichis no longer to be [a moral] consciousness, i.e. not actual.

This con-sciousness is consequently one in which universal and particularare simply one, and its Notion is, therefore, the same as theNotion of the harmony of morality and happiness.

The implicit harmony is thus the unity of what are simpleessentialities, essentialities of thought, and are therefore only ina consciousness. This is then henceforth a master and ruler ofthe world, who brings about the harmony of morality andhappiness, and at the same time sanctifies duties in their multi-plicity. This last means this much, that for the consciousnessof pure duty, the determinate or specific duty cannot straightwaybe sacred; but because a specific duty, on account of the actual‘doing’ whichis a specific action, is likewise necessary, its necessityfalls outside of that consciousness into another consciousness,which thus mediates or brings together the specific and the pureduty and is the reason why the former also has validity.

For the consciousness which acts, and justbecause it acts, the validity of the other consciousness, that ofpure duty, is directly acknowledged; this pure duty is thus thecontent of another consciousness, and is sacred for the con-sciousness that acts only mediately, viz. through the agency ofthis other consciousness."},{"number":608,"text":"Because it is in this way posited that the validation ofduty, as something absolutely sacred, falls outside of actual con-sciousness, this latter accordingly stands altogether on one sideas the imperfect moral consciousness.

Thisbecomes explicit for consciousness in the last phase of the moralview of the world. That is to say, it places pure duty in a beingother than itself, i.e. it posits pure duty partly as something 372 C. (BB.)

For itknows only the pure essence, or the object so far as it is duty, sofar as it is an abstract object of its pure consciousness, as a pureknowing, or as its own self. It thinks, therefore, only in abstrac-tions, and does not comprehend [i.e. in terms of the Notion].Consequently, the object of its actual consciousness is not yettransparent to it; it is not the absolute Notion, which alonegrasps otherness as such, or its absolute opposite, as its own self.It does indeed hold its own reality, like all objective reality,to be unessential; but its freedom is the freedom of pure thought,in contrast to which, therefore, Nature likewise has arisen asan existence that is equally free. Because both are equallypresent in it, i.e. the freedom of [mere] being, and the inclusionof this being within consciousness, its object becomes one thathas being, but at the same time exists only in thought; in the laststage of the moral view of the world, the content is explicitlysuch that its being is given to it by thought, and this conjunctionof being and thought is pronounced to be what in fact it is—imagining."},{"number":612,"text":"When we consider the moral view of the world in sucha way that this objective mode is nothing else than the veryNotion of moral self-consciousness which it makes objective toitself, this awareness of the form of its origin gives rise to itsexposition in another shape.

For the Notion givesit this explicit character, viz. that all reality in general has essen-tial being for it only so far as it is in conformity with duty; and MORALITY 373 this essential being it characterizes as knowledge, i.e. as in im-mediate unity with the actual self. Hence this unity is itselfactual, it ¿is a moral, actual consciousness. This now, gua con-sciousness, pictures its content to itself as an object, viz. as thefinal purpose of the world, as harmony of morality and allreality. But since it thinks of this unity as object, and is not theNotion which has mastery over the object as such, the unityis a negative of self-consciousness for it, or it falls outside of it,as something beyond its actual existence, and yet at the sametime is something that also has being, but a being existing onlyin thought."},{"number":613,"text":"This self-consciousness which, qua self-consciousness, isother than the object, is thus left with the lack of harmonybetween the consciousness of duty and reality, and that, too,its own reality.

Hence, as regards content,they become as such, objects each of which counts as objectfor the other, and as regards form, in such a way that this inter-change is at the same time only imagined [i.e. occurs only inthought], Or, again, the actually non-moral sphere, because it isequally pure thought, and is raised above its actual existence,is yet, in imagination, moral, and is taken to be completelyvalid.

It thus knowsthis latter to be its own self, for it knows itself to be the activeagentthat produces it. It seems, therefore, to attain here its peaceand satisfaction, for this can only be found where it no longerneeds to go beyond its object, because this no longer goesbeyond zt.

At the same time,it is also aware of its contradiction and shiftiness, for it passesfrom one moment, immediately in its relation to this verymoment, over to the opposite. Because a moment has no realityfor it, it posits that very same moment as real: or, what comesto the same thing, in order to assert one moment as possessingbeing in itself, it asserts the opposite as the one that possessesbeing in itself. In so doing it confesses that, as a matter of fact,it is in earnest with neither of them.

Itissupposed to be an implicit harmony, not expli-citly for actual consciousness, not present; on the contrary,what is present is rather only the contradiction of the two. Inthe present, morality is assumed as already in existence, and actu-ality is so placed that it is not in harmony with it. The actualmoral consciousness, however, is one that acts; it is preciselytherein that the actuality ofits morality consists. But in the verydoing or acting, the place [given to actuality] is displaced; forthe action is nothing other than the actualization of the innermoral purpose, nothing other than the production ofan actualitydetermined by the purpose, or of the harmony of the moral purposeand actuality itself. At the same time, the performance of theaction is a fact of which consciousness is aware, it is the presenceof this unity of actuality and purpose, and because, in theaccomplished deed, consciousness knows itself to be actualizedas this particular consciousness, or beholds existence returnedinto itself—and enjoyment consists in this—there is also con-tained in the actuality of the moral purpose that form of actu-ality which is called enjoyment and happiness. Action, there-fore, in fact directly fulfils what wasasserted could not take place,what was supposed to be merely a postulate, merely a beyond.Consciousness thus proclaims through its deed that it is not inearnest in making its postulate, because the meaning of theaction is really this, to make into a present reality what wasnot supposed to exist in the present. And, since the harmonyis postulated for the sake of the action—that is to say, what is toto become actual through action, must be so in itself, otherwiseactuality would not be possible—the connection of action andpostulate is so constituted that, for the sake of the action, i.e.for the sake of the actual harmony of purpose and actuality, thisharmony is postulated as not actual, as a beyond."},{"number":619,"text":"Since action does take place, the lack of fitness betweenpurpose and reality is not taken seriously at all. On the otherhand, action itself does seem to be taken seriously. In point offact, however, the actual deed is only a deed of the individualconsciousness, and therefore itself only something individual,and the result contingent. But the purpose of Reason as the uni-versal, all-embracing purpose, is nothing less than the whole 376 C. (BB.) SPIRIT world ; a final purpose going far beyond the content of this indivi-dual deed, and therefore to be placed altogether beyond any-thing actually done. Because the universal best ought to becarried out, nothing good is done. In fact, however, the nullityof whatis actually done, and the reality of the whole purpose alone,which are now postulated—these, too, are in every respectagain ‘displaced’. The moral action is not something contingentand restricted, for it has as its essence pure duty. This constitutesthe sole entire purpose; and thus the deed, no matter in whatotherwayitscontentis limited, is, gua actualization of that pur-pose, the accomplishment of the entire absolute purpose. Or,again, if reality is taken to be Nature, which has its own lawsand stands in contrast to pure duty, so that duty cannot realizeits law within Nature, then, since it is duty as such that essenti-ally matters, what we are in fact concerned with is not the fulfil-ment of pure duty, which is the whole purpose; for the fulfil-ment would really have as its purpose, not pure duty, but itsantithesis, reality. But there'is again a shift from the positionthat it is not reality with which we are concerned; for accordingto the Notion of moral action, pure duty is essentially an activeconsciousness. Thus there certainly ought to be action, absoluteduty ought to be expressed in the whole of Nature, and morallaw to become natural law."},{"number":620,"text":"If then we allow that it is this highest good that essenti-ally matters, then consciousness is not in earnest with moralityat all.

But if Nature is in con-formity with the moral law, the latter would in fact be violatedby the setting-aside of what is in existence. In the assumptionthat the highest good is what essentially matters, there isadmitted a situation in which moral action is superfluous, anddoes not take place at all. The postulate of the harmony ofmorality and reality—a harmony posited by the Notion ofmoral action, which implies bringing the two into agreement—is expressed from this point of view, too, in the form: ‘Becausemoral action is the absolute purpose, the absolute purpose is,that there should be no such thing as moral action.’"},{"number":621,"text":"When weput together these moments, which conscious- MORALITY 377 ness has traversed in its ideas of morality, it is clear that eachone in turn is superseded in its opposite.

But it is not in earnesteven about this deed, since the deed is something individual ;for it has such a high purpose, the highest good. But this againis only a dissemblance of the facts, for such dissemblance woulddo away with all action and all morality. In other words, con-sciousness is not, strictly speaking, in earnest with moral action:what it really holds to be most desirable, to be the Absolute,is that the highest good be accomplished, and that moral actionbe superfluous."},{"number":622,"text":"From this result consciousness must go on still furtherin its contradictory movement, and of necessity again dissemblethis suppression of moral action. Morality is the ‘in-itself’, themerely implicit element; if it is to be actual, the final purposeof the world cannot be fulfilled ; rather the moral consciousnessmust exist on its own account and find itself confronted by aNature opposed to it. But it must be perfected in its own self.This leads to the second postulate of the harmony of itself andthe Nature which is immediately an element in it, i.e. the sense-nature. Moral self-consciousness asserts that its purpose is pure,is independent of inclinations and impulses, which implies thatit has eliminated within itself sensuous purposes. But thisalleged elimination of the element of sense it dissembles again.It acts, brings its purpose into actual existence, and the self-conscious sense-nature which is supposed to be eliminated isprecisely this middle term or mediating element between pureconsciousness and actual existence— it is the instrument ororgan of the former for its realization, and what is calledimpulse, inclination. Moral self-consciousness is not, therefore,in earnest with the elimination of inclinations and impulses, forit is just these that are the self-realizing self-consciousness. But alsothey ought not to be suppressed, but only to be in conformity withReason. And they are in conformity with Reason, for moralaction is nothing else but consciousness realizing itself, thus giv-ing itself the shape of an impulse, i.e. it is immediately the presentharmony of impulse and morality. But impulse is not in factmerely this empty shape which could have within it a spring 378 C. (BB.) SPIRIT of action other than the one it is, and be impelled by it. Forsense-nature is one which contains within itself its own laws andsprings of action; consequently, morality cannot therefore bein earnest about being itself the mainspring of impulses, theangle of inclination for inclinations. For since these have theirown fixed quality and peculiar content, the consciousness towhich they were to conform would be rather in conformity withthem—a conformity with which moral self-consciousness refusesto comply. The harmony of the two is thus merely implicit,merely postulated. In moral action the actually present harmony of morality andthe sense-nature was just now asserted, but now is ‘displaced’ ;the harmony is beyond consciousness in a nebulous remotenesswhere nothing can any more be accurately distinguishedor comprehended; for our attempt just now to comprehendthis unity failed. In this [merely] implicit harmony, however,consciousness surrenders itself altogether. This implicit har-mony is its moral perfection, where the struggle of morality andthe sense-nature has ceased, and the latter is in conformitywith morality in a way that is beyond our comprehension. Forthat reason this perfection is again only a dissemblance, a falsifi-cation of the situation, since as a matter of fact it would berather morality itself that was given up in that perfection,because it is only consciousness of absolute purpose as pure pur-pose, one therefore opposed to all other purposes. Morality isboth the activity of this pure purpose, and also the consciousnessof rising above sense-nature, of being mixed up with sense-nature and struggling against it. That consciousness is not inearnest about the perfection of morality is indicated by the factthat consciousness itself shifts it away into infinity, i.e. assertsthat the perfection is never perfected."},{"number":623,"text":"What consciousness really holds to be the truth of thematter is only this intermediate state of imperfection, a statenevertheless which at least is supposed to be a progress towardsperfection. But it cannot even be that; for to advance inmorality would really be to move towards its disappearance.That is to say, the goal would be the nothingness or the aboli-tion, mentioned above, of morality and consciousness itself; butto approach ever nearer to nothingness means to diminish.Besides, ‘advancing’ as such, like ‘diminishing’, would assume MORALITY 379 quantitative differences in morality ; but there can be no questionof these in it. In morality, as in consciousness, for which themoral purpose is pure duty, there cannot be any thought at allof difference, least of all of the superficial one of quantity ; thereis only one virtue, only one pure duty, only one morality."},{"number":624,"text":"Since, then, it is not moral perfection that is taken seri-ously, but rather the intermediate state, i.e. as just argued, non-morality, we thus return, from another aspect, to the contentofthe first postulate: viz. we cannot understand how happinessis to be demanded for this moral consciousness on the groundof its worthiness. It is aware of its imperfection and cannot, there-fore, in point of fact demand happiness as a desert, as somethingof which it is worthy. Itcan only ask for happiness to be grantedas a free act of grace, i.e. it can only ask for happiness as such,as something existing in and for itself, and can expect it, noton the absolute ground mentioned above, but as coming to itby chance and caprice. Here, then, non-morality declares justwhat it is—that it is concerned not about morality, but solelyabout happiness as such without reference to morality."},{"number":625,"text":"By this second aspect of the moral view of the world,the other assertion of the first aspect, in which the disharmonyof morality and happiness is assumed, is also nullified. It isclaimed that experience shows that in this present world themoral individual often fares badly, while the immoral indivi-dual often flourishes. But the intermediate state of an imperfectmorality, which has shown itself to be the essential one, clearlyshows that this observation, this supposed experience, is merelya dissemblance of the true state of the case. For since moralityis imperfect, i.e. morality in fact is not, what can there be inthe experience that morality fares badly? Since, at the sametime, it has turned out that it is happiness simply as such thatis involved, it is evident that in making the judgement that theimmoral individual flourishes, it was not intended to imply thatan injustice occurred here. The designation of an individualas immoral necessarily falls away when morality in general is im-perfect, and has therefore only an arbitrary basis. Therefore,the sense and content of the judgement of experience is solelythis, that happiness simply as such should not have been thelot of some individuals, i.e. the judgement is an expression ofenvy which covers itself with the cloak of morality. The reason, 380 C. (BB.) SPIRIT however, why so-called good luck should fall to the lot of others,is good friendship, which grants and wishes them, and itself, too,this lucky chance."},{"number":626,"text":"Morality, then, in the moral consciousness is imperfect;this is now what is put forward. But it is the essence of moralityto be only the perfectly pure; imperfect morality is thereforeimpure, or is immorality. Morality itself thus exists in anotherbeing than the actual consciousness. This other being is a holymoral lawgiver. The imperfect morality in consciousness, whichis the reason for making these postulates, means, in the first in-stance, that morality, when it is posited in consciousness as actual,stands in relation to an ‘other’, to an existence, and thereforeitself receives within it otherness or difference, giving rise to awhole variety of moral laws. The moral self-consciousness atthesame time, however, holds these many duties to be unessen-tial; for it is concerned only with the one pure duty, and themany have no truth for it in so far as they are specific duties. Theycan therefore have their truth only in another being and aremade sacred—which they are not for the moral consciousness—by a holy lawgiver. But this again is only a dissemblance of thereal position. For the moral self-consciousness is its own Abso-lute, and duty is absolutely only what it knows as duty. But dutyit knows only as pure duty; what is not sacred for it is not sacredin itself, and what is not in itself sacred, cannot be made sacredby the holy being. The moral consciousness, too, is not reallyin earnest about letting something be made sacred by anotherconsciousness than itself; for that alone it holds to be sacred whichit has itself made sacred, and is sacred in zt.

Although inthe latter it seems that pure morality alone has validity, theposition must be put in another way, for it is at the same timea natural consciousness. In it, morality is affected and con- MORALITY 381 ditioned by the sense-nature, and is therefore not free and inde-pendent, but contingent on free will; in it, however, as purewill, morality is contingent on knowledge.

The pure moral being, on the other hand, becauseit is above the struggle with Nature and sense, does not standin a negative relation to them. Therefore, in fact, there remainsfor it only the positive relation to them, i.e. just what a momentago was, gua imperfect, held to be immoral. But a pure moralitythat was completely separated from reality, and so likewise waswithout any positive relation to it, would be an unconscious,unreal abstraction in which the concept of morality, which in-volves thinking of pure duty, willing, and doing it, would bedone away with.

Moral self-con-sciousness does indeed let its universality go free so that itbecomesa nature ofits own, and equally it holds fast to it withinitself as a superseded moment. It is, however, merely an in-sincere play of alternating these two determinations. It is as con-science that it first has, in its self-certainty, a content for the previ-ously empty duty, as also for the right and the universal will MORALITY 385 that were empty of content. And because this self-assurance isat the same time an immediacy, conscience exists."},{"number":634,"text":"Moral self-consciousness having attained its truth, ittherefore abandons, or rather supersedes, the internal divisionwhich gave rise to the dissemblance, the division between thein-itself and the self, between pure duty qua pure purpose, andreality gua a Nature and sense opposed to pure purpose.-It is,when thus returned into itself, concrete moral Spirit which, inthe consciousness of pure duty, does not give itself an emptycriterion to be used against actual consciousness; on the con-trary, pure duty, as also the Nature opposed to it, are super-seded moments. Spirit is, in an immediate unity, a self-actualiz-ing being, and the action is immediately something concretelymoral."},{"number":635,"text":"Suppose a case of moral action; it is an objective realityfor the knowing consciousness. This, gua conscience, knows itin an immediate, concrete manner; and at the same time it isonly as conscience knows it. Knowing is contingent in so faras it is something other than the object; but Spirit that is self-certain is no longer such a contingent knower, and a producerof thoughts divorced from reality. On the contrary, since theseparation of the in-itself and the self has been done away with,a case of moral action is, in the sense-certainty of knowing,directly as it is zn itself, and it is in itself only in the way thatit is in this [kind of] knowing. Action qua actualization is thusthe pure form of will—the simple conversion of a reality thatmerely is into a reality that results from action, the conversionof the bare mode of objective knowing [i.e. knowing an object]into one of knowing reality as something produced by conscious-ness. Just as sense-certainty is immediately taken up, or ratherconverted, into the in-itself of Spirit, so this conversion, too,is simple and unmediated, a transition effected by the pureNotion without alteration of the content, the content being de-termined by the interest of the consciousness knowing it.Further, conscience does not split up the circumstances of thecase into a variety of duties. It does not behave as a positive uni-versal medium, wherein the many duties would acquire, each foritself, a fixed substantial nature. If it did, then either no actioncould take place at all, because each concrete case involves anantithesis in general, and, in a case of morality, a clash of 386 C. (BB.) SPIRIT duties—and therefore by the very nature of action one sidewould be injured, one duty violated: or else, if action did takeplace, there would be an actual violation of one of the conflict-ing duties. Conscience is rather the negative One, or absoluteself, which does away with these various moral substances; itis simple action in accordance with duty, which fulfills not thisor that duty, but knows and does what is concretely right. Itis, therefore, first of all moral action qua action into which theprevious moral consciousness that did not act has passed. Theconcrete shape of the deed may be analysed by the conscious-ness looking for distinctions into various properties, i.e. here,into various moral relations; and each of these may either beasserted as absolutely valid (as it must be if it is supposed tobe duty), or else compared and tested. In the simple moralaction of conscience, duties are lumped together in such a waythat all these single entities are straightway demolished, and thesifting of them in the steadfast certainty of conscience to ascer-tain what our duty is, simply does not take place."},{"number":636,"text":"Just as little is there present in conscience that fluctuat-ing uncertainty of consciousness which now places so-calledpure morality outside ofitselfinto another, holy being and takesitself to be unholy, but.then again places so-called pure moralitywithin itself, and the connection of the sensuous with the moralin that other being."},{"number":637,"text":"It renounces all these attitudes and dissemblances, con-nected with the moral view of the world, when it renouncesthat consciousness which thinks of duty and reality as contradic-tory.

But when I really act,I am conscious of an ‘other’, of a reality which is already inexistence, and of a reality I wish to produce; I have a specificpurpose and fulfil a specific duty in which there is somethingelse than the pure duty which alone should be intended. Con-science, on the other hand, is awareness of the fact that, whenthe moral consciousness declares pure duty to be the essence ofits action, this pure purpose is a dissemblance of the truth ofthe matter; for the fact is that pure duty consists in the emptyabstraction of pure thought, and has its reality and its contentonly in a specific reality, in a reality which is the reality of con- MORALITY 387 sciousness itself, and consciousness not as a mere ‘thought-thing’but as an individual. As for conscience itself, this knows thatit has its truth in the immediate certainty of itself. This immediateconcrete self-certainty is the essence [of the action] ; looking atthis certainty from the point of view of the antithesis of con-sciousness, the content of the moral action is the doer’s ownimmediate individuality; and the form of that content is just thisself as a pure movement, viz. as [the individual’s] knowing orhis own conviction."},{"number":638,"text":"Looking more closely at the unity of the moral con-sciousness and at the significance of its moments, we see thatit regards itself as the in-itself or essence; but as conscience, itapprehends its being-for-self or its self.

Consequently, this self constitutes the content ofwhat was previously the empty essence; for it is actual, a selfwhich no longer has the significance of being a nature aliento the essence and, with laws of its own, independent of it.

It is now the law that existsfor the sake of the self, not the self that exists for the sake ofthe law. Law and duty, however, have for that reason the sig-nificance not only of being-for-self but also of intrinsic being; forthis knowing, because it is self-identical, is precisely the in-itself.In consciousness, too, this in-itself separates itself from that im-mediate unity with being-for-self; as thus standing over againstthe latter it is being, a being-for-another. Duty itself, as duty for-saken by the self, is now known to be only a moment ; from signify-ing the absolute essence, it has fallen to the level of mere being,which is not self, is not for itself, and is therefore a being-for-another. But the being-for-another remains an essential momentjust because the self, gua consciousness, constitutes the antithesis 388 C. (BB.)

Conscience is the common element of the two self-consciousnesses, and this element is the substance in which thedeed has an enduring reality, the moment of being recognized andacknowled ged by others. The moral consciousness does not possessthis moment of recognition by others, of pure consciousness whichhas a real existence; and consequently does not act, or actualizeanything atall. Its in-itselfis for it either abstract, unreal essence,or being as a reality which is not spiritual. The existent realityof conscience, however, is one which is a self, an existence whichis conscious of itself, the spiritual element of being recognizedand acknowledged. The action is thus only the translation ofits individual content into the objective element, in which it is uni-versal and recognized, and it is just the fact that it is recognizedthat makes the deed a reality. The deed is recognized andthereby made real because the existent reality is directly linkedwith conviction or knowledge; or, in other words, knowingone’s purpose is directly the element of existence, is universalrecognition. For the essence of the action, duty, consists in con-science’s conviction about it; it is just this conviction that is thein-itself; it is the implicitly universal self-consciousness, or the stateof being recognized, and hence a reality. What is done with theconviction of duty is, therefore, at once something that hasstanding and a real existence. There is, then, no more talk ofgood intentions coming to nothing, or of the good man faringbadly; on the contrary, the duty that is known to be such isfulfilled and becomes a reality, just because what is essentiallya duty is the universal for all self-consciousnesses, is that whichis recognized and acknowledged and thus positively is.

This ‘thing itself’ was there a predicate;but it is in conscience that it is for the first time a subject whichhas made explicit all the moments of consciousness within it,and for which all these moments, substantiality in general,external existence, and the essential nature of thought, are con-tained in this certainty of itself. The ‘thing itself’ has substanti-ality in general in the ethical sphere, external existence inculture, the self-knowing essentiality of thought in morality;and in conscience it is the subject that knows these momentswithin it. While the ‘honest consciousness’ always seizes merelythe empty thing itself, conscience, on the other hand, wins thething in its fullness, a fullness given to it by conscience itself.Conscience is this power because it knows the moments of con-sciousness as moments, dominating them as their negativeessence."},{"number":642,"text":"When conscience is considered in relation to the singledeterminations of the antithesis manifest in action and itsawareness of the nature of those determinations, its relation tothe actual case in which it has to act is, in the first instance,that of knower. In so far as this knowing has in it the momentof universality, conscientious action requires that the actual casebefore it should be viewed unrestrictedly in all its bearings, andtherefore that all the circumstances of the case should be accu-rately known and taken into consideration. But this knowing,since it knows the universality as a moment, is at the same timeaware that it does not know all the circumstances, or, in otherwords, that it does not act conscientiously. The genuinely uni-versal and pure relation of knowing would be a relation to some-thing not containing an antithesis, a relation to itself; but actzon,in virtue of the antithesis it essentially contains, is related toa negative of consciousness, to a reality possessing intrinsic being.Contrasted with the simplicity of pure consciousness, with theabsolute other or implicit manifoldness, this reality is a pluralityof circumstances which breaks up and spreads out endlessly inall directions, backwards into their conditions, sideways intotheir connections, forwards in their consequences. The con-scientious mind is aware of this nature of the thing and of its 390 C. (BB.) SPIRIT relation to it, and knows that, in the case in which it acts, itdoes not possess that full acquaintance with all the attendantcircumstances which is required, and that its pretence of con-scientiously weighing all the circumstances is vain. However,this acquaintance with, and weighing of, all the circumstancesare not altogether lacking; but they exist only as a moment, assomething which is only for others ; and this incomplete knowledgeis held by the conscientious mind to be sufficient and complete,because it is its own knowledge."},{"number":643,"text":"Similarly with the universality of the essence, that is, withthe determination of the content by pure consciousness. Con-science, when it proceeds to action, enters into relation withthe many aspects of the case. The case breaks up into its variousseparate parts and so, too, does the relation of pure conscious-ness to it, with the result that the manifold nature of the casebecomes a multiplicity of duties. Conscience knows that it hasto choose between them, and to make a decision; for none ofthem, in its specific character or in its content, is absolute; onlypure duty is that. But this abstraction [of pure duty] hasattained in its reality the significance of the self-conscious ‘I’.The self-certain Spirit rests, gua conscience, within itself, andits real universality or its duty lies in its pure conviction of duty.This pure conviction is, as such, as empty as pure duty, is purein the sense that there is nothing in it, no specific content thatis aduty. But action is called for, something must be determinedby the individual, and the self-certain Spirit in which the in-itselfhas attained the significance of the self-conscious ‘I’, knowsthat it has this determination and content in the immediate cer-tainty ofitself. This, as a determination and content, is the naturalconsciousness, i.e. impulses and inclinations. Conscience doesnot recognize the absoluteness of any content, for it is the abso-lute negativity of everything determinate. It determines fromits own self; but the sphere of the self into which falls the deter-minateness as such is the so-called sense-nature; to have a con-tent taken from the immediate certainty of itself means thatit has nothing to draw on but sense-nature. Everything thatin previous forms of experience presented itself as good or bad,as law and right, is something other than the immediate cer-tainty of self; it is a universal which is now a being-for-another.Or, looked at from another aspect, it is an object which, while MORALITY 391 mediating consciousness with itself, comes between conscious-ness and its own truth, so that instead of the object being theimmediacy of consciousness, it rather cuts consciousness offfrom itself. For conscience, however, self-certainty is the pure,immediate truth; and this truth is thus its immediate certaintyofself, conceived as content, i.e. this truth is in general the capriceof the individual, and the contingency of his unconsciousnatural being [his sense-nature]."},{"number":644,"text":"This content at the same time counts as a moral essenti-ality or as duty. For pure duty, as was found when testing laws,is utterly indifferent to any content and tolerates any content.Here it has, at the same time, the essential form of being-for-self, and this form of individual conviction is nothing else butconsciousness of the emptiness of pure duty and of the fact thatpure duty is only a moment, that its substantiality is a predicatewhich has its subject in the individual, whose caprice gives itits content and can associate every content with this form andattach its conscientiousness to the content. An individual in-creases his property in a certain way; it is everyone’s duty toprovide for the support of himself and his family, and no lessto have regard to the possibility of being useful to his fellow men,and of doing good to those in need. The individual is awarethat this is a duty, for this content is directly contained in hiscertainty of himself; furthermore, he perceives that he fulfilsthis duty in this particular case. Others, perhaps, hold this spe-cific way of behaving to be humbug; they hold to other aspectsof the concrete case, he, however, holds firmly to this aspect,because he is conscious of the increase of property as a pureduty. Thus, what others call violence and wrongdoing, is thefulfilment of the individual’s duty to maintain his independencein face of others; what they call cowardice, is the duty of sup-porting life and the possibility of being useful to others; butwhat theycall courage violates both duties. But cowardice can-not be so inept as not to know that the preservation of life andthe possibility of being useful to others are duties—so inept asnot to be convinced of the moral obligatoriness of its action, andnot to know that this obligatoriness consists in knowing it to besuch. Otherwise it would be guilty of ineptitude, of beingimmoral. Since morality lies in the consciousness of having ful-filled one’s duty, this will not be lacking when the action is 392 C. (BB.) SPIRIT called cowardice any more than when itis called courage. Theabstraction called duty, being capable of any content, is alsocapable of cowardice. The doer, then, knows what he does tobe a duty, and since he knows this, and the conviction of dutyis the very essence of moral obligation, he is thus recognizedand acknowledged by others. The action is thereby validatedand has an actual existence."},{"number":645,"text":"It is of no use to object to this freedom, which placesany and every kind of content in the universal passive mediumof ‘duty’ and ‘knowing’, by maintaning that another contentought to have been placed in it; for whatever content it be,itcontains the blemish of determinateness from which pure knowingis free, determinateness which pure knowing.can disdainfullyreject, or equally can accept. Every content, because it isdeterminate, stands on the same level as any other, even if itdoes seem to be characterized by the elimination in it of theelement of particularity. It may seem that, since, in the actualcase, duty in general is sundered into an antithesis and therebyinto the antithesis of individuality and universality, the dutywhose contentis the universal itself directly contains the natureof pure duty, and form and content are thus completely inaccord. It might seem, then, that action for the general goodis to be preferred to action for the good of the individual; butthis universal duty is simply what already exists as absolute sub-stance, as law and right, and is valid on its own account in-dependently of the individual’s knowledge and conviction, notto mention his own immediate interest. It is, therefore, preciselyagainst the form of that duty that morality in general is directed.But as regards its content, that too is a determinate content, in sofar as the general good is opposed to the good of the individual.Consequently, its law is one from which conscience knows itselfto be absolutely free, and it gives itself the authority to add toand take from, to neglect as well as fulfil it. Then, again, theabove distinction between duty to the individual and duty tothe universal is, in accordance with the nature of the antithesisas such, not something definitely fixed. The truth is rather thatwhat the individual does for himself also contributes to thegeneral good; the more he has made provision for himself, notonly is there a greater possibility of his being of service to others,but his actual existence itself consists only in his being and living MORALITY 393 in contact with others. His individual enjoyment essentially hasthe meaning of putting what is his own at the disposal of othersand of helping them to obtain their enjoyment. Therefore, inthe fulfilment of duty to individuals and so to oneself, the dutyto the universal is also fulfilled. Any weighing and comparingof duties which might be made here would be tantamount tocalculating the advantage accruing to the universal from anaction. But firstly, the result would be that morality would bemade dependent on the necessary contingency of insight, andsecondly, it is precisely the essence of conscience to have notruck with this calculating and weighing of duties, and to makeits own decision without reference to any such reasons."},{"number":646,"text":"In this way, then, conscience acts and preserves itselfin the unity of its essential and actual being, in the unity of purethought and individuality: it is the self-assured Spirit which hasits truth within ztsel/, in its knowledge, and therein as knowledgeof duty. It maintains itself therein by the very fact that whatis positive in the action—the content as well as the form of dutyand the knowledge of it—belongs to the self, to the certaintyof itself; but what seeks to confront the self with an essential beingof its own is held to be something not true, something strippedof its self-subsistence and only a moment. Consequently, whatcounts is not simply knowing in general, but conscience’s know-ledge of the circumstances. It places in duty, as the universalin-itselfness, the content which it takes from its natural indivi-duality ; for the content is one that is present within itself. Thiscontent, in virtue of the universal medium in which it exists,becomes the duty which it carries out, and empty pure duty,just through this action, becomes established as something notself-subsistent, as only a moment; this content is the cancelledemptiness of pure duty, or its fulfilment. But even so, conscienceis free from any content whatever; it absolves itself from anyspecific duty which is supposed to have the validity of law. Inthe strength of its own self-assurance it possesses the majestyofabsolute autarky, to bind and to loose. This self-determinationis therefore without more ado absolutely in conformity withduty.

The duty which it fulfils is a specific con-tent; it is true that this content is the selfof consciousness, andso consciousness’s knowledge of itself, its identity with itself. Butonce fulfilled, set in the medium of being, this identity is nolonger knowing, no longer this process of differentiation inwhich its differences are at the same time immediately super-seded; on the contrary, in being, the difference is establishedas an enduring difference, and the action is a specific action, notidentical with the element of everyone’s self-consciousness, andtherefore not necessarily acknowledged. Both sides, the con-science that acts and the universal consciousness that acknow-ledges this action as duty, are equally free from the specificityof this action. On account of this freedom, their relationshipin the common medium of their connection is really a relationof complete disparity, as a result of which the consciousnesswhich is explicitly aware of the action finds itself in a state ofcomplete uncertainty about the Spirit which does the action andis certain of itself. The latter acts, it gives being to a specificcontent; others hold to this being as this Spirit’s truth, and aretherein certain of this Spirit; it has declared therein what it holdsto be duty. But it is free from any specific duty; it is not presentat that point where others imagine it actually to be; and thisvery medium of being, and duty as something possessing intrinsicbeing, count for it only as a moment. What, therefore, it placesbefore them it also ‘displaces’ again, or rather has straightway‘displaced’ or dissembled.

Language is self-consciousness existing for others, self-con-sciousness which as such is immediately present, and as this self-consciousness is universal.

(BB.) SPIRIT returned into itself, is certain of itself, and certain in itself ofits truth, or of its own recognition [of that truth], and whichis acknowledged as knowing it. The language of the ethicalSpirit is law and simple command, and complaint, which ismore the shedding of a tear about necessity. Moral conscious-ness, on the other hand, is still dumb, shut up with itself withinits inner life, for there the self does not as yet have an existence:existence and the self stand as yet only in an external relationto each other. Language, however, only emerges as the middleterm, mediating between independent and acknowledged self-consciousnesses ; and the existent selfis immediately universal ac-knowledgement, an acknowledgement on the part of many, andin this manifoldness a simple acknowledgement. The contentof the language ofconscience is the self that knows itself as essentialbeing. This alone is what it declares, and this declaration is thetrue actuality of the act, and the validating of the action. Con-sciousness declares its conviction ; it is in this conviction alone thatthe action is a duty; also it is valid as duty solely through theconviction being declared. For universal self-consciousness is freefrom the specific action that merely is; what is valid for that self-consciousness is not the action as an existence, but the convictionthat it is a duty; and this is made actual in language. To makethedeeda reality doesnot mean here translating its content fromthe form of purpose or being-for-self into the form of an abstractreality: it means translating it from the form of immediateself-certainty, which knows its knowledge or being-for-self to beessential being, into the form of an assurance that consciousnessis convinced of its duty and, as conscience, knows in its own mindwhat duty is. This assurance thus affirms that consciousness isconvinced that its conviction is the essence of the matter.654. Whether the assurance of acting from a conviction ofduty is true, whether what is done is actually a duty—these ques-tions or doubts have no meaning when addressed to conscience.To ask whether the assurance is true would presuppose thatthe inner intention is different from the one put forward, i.e.that what the individual self wills, can be separated from duty,from the will of the universal and pure consciousness ; the latterwould be put into words, but the former would be strictly thetrue motive of the action. But this distinction between the uni-versal consciousness and the individual selfis just what has been MORALITY 397 superseded, and the supersession of it is conscience. The self’simmediate knowing that is certain of itself is law and duty. Itsintention, through being its own intention, is what is right; allthat is required is that it should know this, and should stateits conviction that its knowing and willing are right. Thedeclaration of this assurance in itself rids the form of its particu-larity. It thereby acknowledges the necessary universality of the self.In calling itself conscience, it calls itself pure knowledge of itselfand pure abstract willing, i.e. it calls itself a universal knowingand willing’which recognizes and acknowledges others, is thesame as them—for they are just this pure self-knowing and will-ing—and which for that reason is also recognized and acknow-ledged by them. In the will of the self that is certain of itself,in this knowledge that the self is essential being, lies the essenceof what is right. Therefore, whoever says he acts in such andsuch a way from conscience, speaks the truth, for his conscienceis the self that knows and wills. But it is essential that he shouldsay so, for this self must be at the same time the universal self.It is not universal in the content of the act, for this, on accountof its specificity, is intrinsically an indifferent affair: it is in theform of the act that the universality lies. It is this form whichis to be established as actual: it is the self which as such is actualin language, which declares itself to be the truth, and just byso doing acknowledges all other selves and is acknowledged bythem."},{"number":655,"text":"Conscience, then, in the majesty of its elevation abovespecific law and every content of duty, puts whatever contentit pleases into its knowing and willing. It is the moral geniuswhich knows the inner voice of what it immediately knows tobe a divine voice; and since, in knowing this, it has an equallyimmediate knowledge of existence, it is the divine creativepower which in its Notion possesses the spontaneity of life.Equally, it is in its own self divine worship, for its action is thecontemplation of its own divinity."},{"number":656,"text":"This solitary divine worship is at the same time essenti-ally the divine worship of a community, and the pure inner know-ing and perceiving of itself advances to the moment of cons¢ious-ness. The contemplation of itself is its objective existence and thisobjective element is the declaration of its knowing and willingas something universal. Through this declaration the self 398 C. (BB.) SPIRIT acquires moral validity and the act becomes an effective deed.The actuality and lasting existence of what it does is universalself-consciousness; but the declaration of conscience affirms thecertainty of itself to be pure self, and’ thereby to be a universalself. On account of this utterance in which the self is expressedand acknowledged as essential being, the validity of the act isacknowledged by others. The spirit and substance of theirassociation are thus the mutual assurance of their conscientious-ness, good intentions, the rejoicing over this mutual purity, andthe refreshing of themselves in the glory of knowing and utter-ing, of cherishing and fostering, such an excellent state of affairs.In so far as this conscience still distinguishes its abstract con-sciousness from its self-consciousness, it has only a hidden life inGod; it is true that God is immediately present in its mind andheart, in its self; but what is manifest, its actual consciousnessand the mediating movement of that consciousness, is for itsomething other than that hidden inner life and the immediacyof God’s presence. It is only in the completed form of consciencethat the distinction between its abstract consciousness and itsself-consciousness is eliminated. Conscience knows that theabstract consciousness is just this self, this being-for-itself that iscertain of itself, knows that it is precisely in the immediacy ofthe relation of the self to the in-itsel/—which when posited outsidethe self is an abstract God and hidden from it—that the dif-ference is eliminated. For that relation is a mediating one inwhich the related terms are not one and the same, but eachis an other for the other, and only in a third term are they one.The immediate relation, however, means in fact nothing else butthe unity of the terms. The consciousness that has risen abovethe thoughtlessness that still holds these differences—which arenone—to be differences, knows the immediacy of the presencewithin it of the absolute Being as the unity of that Being andits own self: it thus knows itselfas the living in-itself, and knowsthat this knowledge is religion, which as knowledge that hasa perceived or outer existence is the utterance of the communityconcerning its own Spirit."},{"number":657,"text":"Here, then, we see self-consciousness withdrawn into itsinnermost being, for which all externality as such hasvanished—withdrawn into the contemplation of the ‘I’ =‘T’, inwhich this ‘I’ is the whole of essentiality and existence.

As consciousness, it is divided intothe antithesis of itself and its object which is, for it, essence;but it is just this object that is perfectly transparent, is its ownself, and its consciousness is only this knowledge of itself. Alllife, all spiritual essentiality, has withdrawn into this self andhas lost its difference from the Z itself. The moments of con-sciousness are, therefore, these extreme abstractions, none ofwhich endures but each of which loses itself in the other andproduces it. It is the fluctuating attitude to itself of the UnhappyConsciousness; but here this fluctuation takes place explicitlyfor consciousness within itself, and is conscious of being theNotion of Reason, whereas the Unhappy Consciousness is onlyimplicitly that Notion. The absolute certainty of itself thus findsitself, gua consciousness, changed immediately into a sound thatdies away, into an objectification of its being-for-self; but thiscreated world is its speech, which likewise it has immediatelyheard and only the echo of which returns to it. This return,therefore, does not mean that the self is in essence and actualitypresent in its speech; for essence is not for it an it-self or merelyimplicit being, but its very self. Just as little has consciousnessan outer existence, for the objective aspect does not get as far asbeing a negative of the actual self, in the same way that thisself does not attain to an actual existence. It lacks the powerto externalize itself, the power to make itself into a Thing, and 400 C. (BB.) SPIRIT to endure [mere] being. It lives in dread of besmirching thesplendour of its inner being by action and an existence; and,in order to preserve the purity ofits heart, it flees from contactwith the actual world, and persists in its self-willed impotenceto renounce its self which is reduced to the extreme of ultimateabstraction, and to give itselfa substantial existence, or to trans-form its thought into being and put its trust in the absolute dif-ference [between thought and being]. The hollow object whichit has produced for itself now fills it, therefore, with a sense ofemptiness. Its activity is a yearning which merely loses itselfas consciousness becomes an object devoid of substance, and,rising above this loss, and falling back on itself, finds itself onlyas a lost soul. In this transparent purity of its moments, an un-happy, so-called ‘beautiful soul’, its light dies away within it,and it vanishes like a shapeless vapour that dissolves into thinair."},{"number":659,"text":"This silent fusion of the pithless essentialities of the eva-porated life has, however, still to be taken in the other meaningof the actuality of conscience, and in the manifestation of its move-ment: conscience has to be considered as acting.

The knowledge that knows itselfis, gua this particular self, distinct from other selves; the lan-guage in which all reciprocally acknowledge each other as act-ing conscientiously, this universal identity, falls apart into thenon-identity of individual being-for-self: each consciousness isjust as much simply reflected out of its universality into itself.As a result, the antithesis of individuality to other individuals,and to the universal, inevitably comes on the scene, and wehave to consider this relationship and its movement. In otherwords, this universality and duty have the very opposite signifi-cance of the specific individuality that exempts itself from theuniversal, for which pure duty is only a universality thatappears on the surface, and is turned outwards: duty is onlya matter of words, and counts as a being-for-another. Con-science, which in the first instance is only negatively directedagainst duty as this given specific duty, knows itself to be free fromit; but since it fills the empty duty with a specific content fromitself, it is positively aware that it, as this particular self, makesthe content. Its pure self, as an empty knowing, is something MORALITY 401 devoid of content and determination. The content which itgives to that knowing is taken from its own self, as this specificself, is taken from itselfas a natural individuality. And, in speak-ing of the conscientiousness of its action, it may well be awareof its pure self, but in the purpose of its action, a purpose withan actual content, it is aware of itself as this particular indivi-dual, and is conscious of the antithesis between what it is foritself and what it is for others, of the antithesis of universalityor duty and its reflection out of universality into itself."},{"number":660,"text":"While in this way the antithesis, into which conscienceenters when it acts, expresses itself in its inner being, the anti-thesis is at the same time a disparity on its outer side in theelement of existence, the disparity of its particular individualityin relation to another individual.

In contrast to this inter-nal determination there thus stands the element of existenceor universal consciousness, for which the essential being israther universality, duty; while individuality, on the otherhand, which in contrast to the universal is for itself, counts onlyas a superseded moment. For the consciousness which holdsfirmly to duty, the first consciousness counts as evil, because ofthe disparity between its inner being and the universal; and since,at the same time, this first consciousness declares its action tobe in conformity with itself, to be duty and conscientiousness,it is held by the universal consciousness to be hypocrisy."},{"number":661,"text":"The movement of this antithesis is in the first instance theformal production of an identity of what the evil consciousnessis in its own self and what it declares itself to be; it must bemade apparent that it ¿s evil, and thus its existence made tocorrespond to its essence; the hypocrisy must be unmasked.This return of the disparity present in hypocrisy into a corre-spondence is not already an accomplished fact because hypo-crisy, as is Commonly said, demonstrates its respect for duty andvirtue just by making a show of them, and using them as a maskto hide itself from its own consciousness, no less than fromothers; as if in this acknowledgement of the antithesis within 402 C. (BB.) SPIRIT itself, identity and correspondence were implied. Only, it is atthe same time just as much reflected out of this spoken acknow-ledgement and into itself; and the fact that it uses what is anessence as a being-for-another implies rather its own contempt forthat essence, and the exposure to everyone of its own lack ofany substantial being.

In otherwords, since the one-sided persistence in one extreme cancelsitself out, evil would, it is true, thereby confess to being evil,but in so doing it would directly abolish itself and cease to behypocrisy, and would not, as such, unmask itself. It admits, infact, to being evil by asserting that it acts, in opposition to theacknowledged universal, according to its own inner law andconscience. For if this law and conscience were not the law ofits single individuality and caprice, it would not be somethinginner or peculiar to it, but what is universally acknowledged.Therefore, when anyone says that he is acting according to hisown law and conscience against others, he is saying, in fact, thathe is wronging them. But actual conscience is not this persistencein a knowing and willing that opposes itself to. the universal ;on the contrary, the universal is the element of its existence,and its language declares its action to be an acknowledged duty."},{"number":663,"text":"Justas little is the persistence of the universal conscious-ness in its judgement an unmasking and abolition of hypocrisy.In denouncing hypocrisy as base, vile, and so on, it is appealingin such judgement to its own law, just as the evil consciousnessappeals to its law.

Andthis zeal does the very opposite of what it means to do; for it MORALITY 403 shows that what it calls true or genuine duty and which oughtto be universally acknowledged, is something not acknowledged ;in so doing it concedes to the other an equal right to be for itself."},{"number":664,"text":"This judgement has, however, at the same time anotheraspect from which it becomes the way to a resolution of theantithesis confronting it. The consciousness of the universal, inits relation to the first [evil] consciousness, does not behave asone that is actual and acts—for the latter is rather the actualconsciousness—but in its antithesis to it, is a consciousness thatis not entangled in the antithesis of individuality and uni-versality, which occurs when action is entered upon. It remainsin the universality of thought, behaves as a consciousness thatapprehends, and its first action is merely one of judgement. Now,through this judgement, it places itself, as we have justremarked, alongside the first consciousness, and the latter, throughthis likeness, comes to see its own self in this other consciousness.For the consciousness of duty maintains an attitude of passiveapprehension; but it is thereby in contradiction with itself asthe absolute will of duty, as a consciousness whose determiningcomes solely from itself. It does well to preserve itself in itspurity, for it does not act; it is the hypocrisy which wants its judg-ing to be taken for an actual deed, and instead of proving itsrectitude by actions, does so by uttering fine sentiments. Itsnature, then, is altogether the same as that which is reproachedwith making duty a mere matter of words. In both alike, theside of reality is distinct from the words uttered: in the one,through the selfish purpose of the action, in the other, throughthe failure to act at all, although the necessity to act is involvedin the very talk of duty, for duty without deeds is utterly mean-ingless."},{"number":665,"text":"Judging, however, is also to be looked at as a positiveact of thought and has a positive content. Through this aspect,the contradiction present in the apprehending consciousness,and its identity with the first consciousness, become still morecomplete. The consciousness that acts declares its specific actionto be a duty, and the consciousness that judges it cannot denythis; for duty itself is the form which lacks all content but iscapable of any. In other words, the concrete action which inits many-sidedness is in its own self diverse, contains the uni-versal aspect—that which is taken as duty—just as much as the 404 C. (BB.) SPIRIT particular aspect which constitutes the share and interest of theindividual in the action. Now, the judging consciousness doesnot stop short at the former aspect of duty, at the doer’s know-ledge of it, that this is his duty, and at the fact that the doerknows it to be his duty, the condition and status of his reality.On the contrary, it holds to the other aspect, looks at what theaction is in itself, and explains it as resulting from an intentiondifferent from the action itself, and from selfish motives. Just asevery action is capable of being looked at from the point of viewof conformity to duty, so too can it be considered from the pointof view of the particularity [of the doer]; for, qua action, it isthe actuality of the individual. This judging of the action thustakes it out of its outer existence and reflects it into its inneraspect, or into the form of its own particularity. If the actionis accompanied by fame, then it knows this inner aspect to bea desire for fame. If it is altogether in keeping with the stationof the individual, without going beyond this station, and of sucha nature that the individuality does not possess its station asa character externally attached to it, but through its own selfgives filling to this universality, thereby showing itself capableof a higher station, then the inner aspect of the action is judgedto be ambition, and so on. Since, in the action as such, the doerattains to a vision of himself in objectivity, or to a feeling of selfin his existence, and thus to enjoyment, the inner aspect isjudged to be an urge to secure his own happiness, even thoughthis were to consist merely in an inner moral conceit, in theenjoyment of being conscious of his own superiority and in theforetaste of a hope of future happiness. No action can escapesuch judgement, for duty for duty’s sake, this pure purpose, isan unreality; it becomes a reality in the deed of an individu-ality, and the action is thereby charged with the aspect of parti-cularity. No man is a hero to his valet; not, however, becausethe man is not a hero, but because the valet—is a valet, whosedealings are with the man, not as a hero, but as one who eats,drinks, and wears clothes, in general, with his individual wantsand fancies. Thus, for the judging consciousness, there is noaction in which it could not oppose to the universal aspect ofthe action, the personal aspect of the individuality, and playthe part of the moral valet towards the agent.! 1 CF Lectures on Philosophy of World History (H. B. Nisbet’s transl. p. 87). MORALITY 405"},{"number":666,"text":"The consciousness that judges in this way is itself base,because it divides up the action, producing and holding fastto the disparity of the action with itself. Further, it is hypocrisy,because it passes off such judging, not as another manner ofbeing wicked, but as the correct consciousness of the action,setting itself up in this unreality and conceit of knowing welland better above the deeds it discredits, and wanting its wordswithout deeds to be taken for a superior kind of reality. By put-ting itself, then, in this way on a level with the doer on whomit passes judgement, it is recognized by the latter as the sameas himself. This latter does not merely find himself apprehendedby the other as something alien and disparate from it, but ratherfinds that other, according to its own nature and disposition,identical with himself. Perceiving this identity and givingutterance to it, he confesses this to the other, and equally expectsthat the other, having in fact put himself on the same level,will also respond in words in which he will give utterance tothis identity with him, and expects that this mutual recognition-will now exist in fact. His confession is not an abasement, ahumiliation, a throwing-away of himself in relation to theother; for this utterance is not a one-sided affair, which wouldestablish his disparity with the other: on the contrary, he giveshimself utterance solely on account of his having seen hisidentity with the other; he, on his side, gives expression to theircommon identity in his confession, and gives utterance to it forthe reason that language is the existence of Spirit as an immediateself. He therefore expects that the other will contribute his partto this existence."},{"number":667,"text":"But the confession of the one who is wicked, ‘I am so’,is not followed by a reciprocal similar confession. This was notwhat the judging consciousness meant: quite the contrary. Itrepels this community of nature, and is the hard heart that isfor itself, and which rejects any continuity with the other. Asa result, the situation is reversed. The one who made the con-fession sees himself repulsed, and sees the other to be in the wrongwhen he refuses to let his own inner being come forth into theouter existence of speech, when the other contrasts the beautyof his own soul with the penitent’s wickedness, yet confrontsthe confession of the penitent with his own stiff-necked un-repentant character, mutely keeping himself to himself and 406 C. (BB.) SPIRIT refusing to throw himself away for someone else. There is hereexpressed in its extreme form the rebellion of the Spirit thatis certain of itself; for it beholds itself, as this simple self-know-ledge, in someone else, and, too, in such a way that even theouter shape of this other is not, as in the case of material wealth,something without substantial being, is not a Thing; on the con-trary, what is held opposed to this other is Thought, simplyknowledge itself, this absolutely fluid continuity of pure knowingwhich refuses to put itself into communication with the otherwhich, in its confession, had ipso facto renounced its separatebeing-for-self, and thereby expressly superseded its particularity,and in so doing posited itself in continuity with the other asa universal. The other, however, retains within itself and for itselfits uncommunicative being-for-self; and it retains, in face of theindividual who did confess, just the same uncommunicativebeing-for-self, although the latter has already thrown this away.It thereby reveals itself as a consciousness which is forsaken byand which itself denies Spirit; for it does not know that Spirit,in the absolute certainty of itself, is lord and master over everydeed and actuality, and can cast them off, and make them asif they had never happened. At the same time, it does not recog-nize the contradiction it falls into in not letting the rejectionwhich has taken place in words, be validated as a genuine rejec-tion, while itself has the certainty of its Spirit, not in an actualdeed, but in its inner being, and finds the outer existence ofthis inner being in the utterance of its judgement. It is thus itsown self which hinders that other’s return from the deed intothe spiritual existence of speech and into the identity of Spirit,and by this hardness of heart produces the disparity which stillexists."},{"number":668,"text":"Now, in so far as the self-certain Spirit, as a ‘beautifulsoul’, does not possess the power to renounce the knowledgeof itself which it keeps to itself, it cannot attain to an identitywith the consciousness it has repulsed, nor therefore to a visionof the unity of itself in the other, cannot attain to an objectiveexistence. Consequently, the identity comes about only nega-tively, as a being devoid of Spirit. The ‘beautiful soul’, lackingan actual existence, entangled in the contradiction between itspure self and the necessity of that self to externalize itself andchange itself into an actual existence, and dwelling in the imme- MORALITY 407 diacy of this firmly held antithesis—an immediacy which aloneis the middle term reconciling the antithesis, which has beenintensified to its pure abstraction, and is pure being or emptynothingness—this ‘beautiful soul’, then, being conscious of thiscontradiction in its unreconciled immediacy, is disordered tothe point of madness, wastes itself in yearning and pines awayin consumption.

The woundsof the Spirit heal, and leave no scars behind. The deed is notimperishable; it is taken back by Spirit into itself, and the aspectof individuality present in it, whether as intention or as anexistent negativity and limitation, straightway vanishes. Theself that carries out the action, the form ofits act, is only a momentof the whole, and so likewise is the knowledge, that by its judge-ment determines and establishes the distinction between the in-dividual and universal aspects of the action. The evil conscious-ness, referred to above, posits this externalization of itself, orposits itself, as a moment, being enticed into openly confessingitself by the vision of itself in the other. But just as the formerhas to surrender its one-sided, unacknowledged existence of itsparticular being-for-self, so too must this other set aside its one-sided, unacknowledged judgement.

The former is the pure continuityof the universal, which is aware that the individuality whichis conscious of itself as essence, is intrinsically a nullity, is evil.This, however, is the absolute discreteness which is consciousof itself in its pure oneness as absolute, and of the universal assomething unreal, which exists only for someone else. Both aspectsare purified into the unity in which there is no longer in themany existence devoid of self, any negative of consciousness,where, on the contrary, duty is the unchanging identical charac-ter of its self-knowledge, and evil equally has its purpose in itsbeing-within-itself, and its actuality in its utterance. The contentof this utterance is the substance of its enduring existence; itis the assurance of Spirit’s immanent self-certainty. Each ofthese two self-certain Spirits has no other purpose than its ownpure self, and no other reality and existence than just this pureself. But yet they are different; and the difference is absolutebecause it is set in this element of the pure Notion. It is alsoabsolute, not only for us, but for the Notions themselves whichstand in this antithesis. For these Notions, though specific in rela-tion to one another, are at the same time in themselves uni-versal, so that they fill out the whole range of the self, and thisself has no other content than this its own determinateness,which neither goes beyond the self nor is more restricted thanit; for one of them, the absolute universal, is equally the pureknowledge of itself; as the other is the absolute discreteness of MORALITY 409 individuality, and both are only this pure self-knowledge. Bothdeterminatenesses are thus pure conscious Notions, whosedeterminatenness is itself immediately a knowing, or whose rela-tionship and antithesis is the ‘I’.

Spirit which, to beginwith, has an immediate knowledge of itself is thus to itself Spiritin the form of immediacy, and the determinateness of the formin which it appears to itself is that of [mere] being. This being,itis true, is filled neither with sensation nor a manifold material,nor with any other kind of one-sided moments, purposes, anddeterminations: it is filled with Spirit and is known by itselfto be all truth and reality. Such filling is not identical with itsshape, Spirit qua essence is not identical with its consciousness.Spirit is actual as absolute Spirit only when it is also for itselfin its truth as it is in its certainty of itself, or when the extremesinto which, as consciousness, it parts itself are explicitly for eachother in the shape of Spirit. The shape which Spirit assumesas object of its consciousness remains filled by the certainty ofSpirit as by its substance; through this content, the object is 416 C. (CC.) RELIGION saved from being degraded to pure objectivity, to the form ofnegativity of self-consciousness. Spirit’s immediate unity withitself is the basis, or pure consciousness, within which conscious-ness parts asunder [into the duality of subject and object]. Inthis way Spirit, shut up within its pure self-consciousness, doesnot exist in religion as the creator of a Nature in general; whatit does create in this movement are its shapes qua Spirits, whichtogether constitute the completeness of its manifestation. Andthis movement itselfis the genesis ofits complete reality throughits individual aspects, or through its incomplete shapes."},{"number":683,"text":"The first reality of Spirit is the Notion of religion itself,or religion as immediate, and therefore Natural Religion. In this,Spirit knows itself as its object in a natural or immediate shape.The second reality, however, is necessarily that in which Spiritknows itself in the shape of a superseded natural existence, or ofthe self. This, therefore, is the Religion of Art; for the shaperaises itself to the form of the self through the creative activityof consciousness whereby this beholds in its object its act or theself. Finally, the third reality overcomes the one-sidedness ofthe first two; the selfis just as much an immediacy, as the imme-diacy is the self. If, in the first reality, Spirit in general is inthe form of consciousness, and in the second, in that of self-con-sciousness, in the third it is in the form of the unity of both.It has the shape of being-in-and-for-itself; and when it is thusconceived as it is in and for itself, this is the Revealed Religion.But although in this, Spirit has indeed attained its true shape,yet the shape itself and the picture-thought are still the un-vanquished aspect from which Spirit must pass over into theNotion, in order wholly to resolve therein the form of objec-tivity, in the Notion which equally embraces within itself itsown opposite. It is then that Spirit has grasped the Notion ofitself, just as we now have first grasped it; and its shape or theelement of its existence, being the Notion, is Spirit itself. A. NATURAL RELIGION"},{"number":684,"text":"The Spirit that knows Spirit is consciousness of itself andis present to itself in objective form; it is; and is at the sametime being that is for itself. It is for itself, it is the aspect of self-consciousness, and that too, in contrast to the aspect of its con- NATURAL RELIGION 417 sciousness, or of the relating of itself to itself as object. In its con-sciousness there is antithesis, and in consequence the specificcharacter of the ‘shape’ in which it appears to itself and knowsitself. It is solely with this that we are concerned in thistreatment of religion; for we have already considered its un-embodied essence, or its pure Notion. But at the same time thedifference of consciousness and self-consciousness falls withinthe latter ; the ‘shape’ of religion contains, not the existence ofSpirit as Nature that is free from thought, nor as a thought thatis free from existence; but it is an existence that is preservedin thinking, and also something thought that is objectivelypresent to it. It is in accordance with the specific character ofthis ‘shape’ in which Spirit knows itself that one religion is dis-tinguished from another ; but we have at the same time to notethat the exposition of this knowledge of itself within the frame-work of this single specific character does not in fact exhaustthe totality ofan actual religion. The series of different religionswhich will come to view, just as much sets forth again onlythe different aspects of a single religion, and, moreover, ofevery single religion, and the ideas which seem to distinguishone actual religion from another occur in each one. At thesame time, however, the difference must also be viewed asa difference of religion. For since Spirit lives in the differenceof its consciousness and its self-consciousness, the aim of themovement is to supersede this cardinal distinction and togive the form of self-consciousness to the ‘shape’ that is theobject of consciousness. But this difference is not supersededsimply by the fact that the ‘shapes’ contained by self-con-sciousness have within them the moment of self, and that Godis thought of as self-consciousness. The self that is thought of is notthe actual self; in order that the self, like any other more precisedetermination of ‘shape’, may in truth belong to this ‘shape’,it must, on the one hand, be posited in the ‘shape’ by the actofself-consciousness, and, on the other hand, the lower determi-nation mustshow itself to be reduced to a moment of the higherand to be comprehended by it. For what is thought of, ceasesto be something [merely] thought of, something alien to theself’s knowledge, only when the self has produced it, and there-fore beholds the determination of the object as its own, con-sequently beholds itself in the object. Through this activity, the 418 C. (CC.) RELIGION lower determination has at the same time vanished; for the actis the negative that is realized at the expense of something else.In so far as the lower determination is still present, it hasretreated into an unessential aspect; just as, on the other hand,where the lower is still dominant but the higher is also present,the one determination devoid of self has its place alongside theother. Accordingly, if the various ideas within a particular reli-gion do indeed exhibit the entire movement of its ‘shapes’, thecharacter of each idea is determined by the particular unityof consciousness and self-consciousness [in that religion], i.e. bythe fact that self-consciousness embraces within itself the deter-mination of the object of consciousness, by its act has completelyappropriated it and knows it as the essential determination inface of the other. The truth of the belief in a determination ofthe religious Spirit is revealed in the fact that the constitutionof the actual Spirit is similar to that of the ‘shape’ in which Spiritbeholds itself in the religion—as, e.g., the incarnation of Godwhich occurs in oriental religion has no truth, because theactual Spirit of that religion is without this reconciliation. Itis inappropriate here to return from the totality of determina-tions to the individual ones, and to show in which ‘shape’ withinthe totality and its particular religion the others are containedin their completeness. The higher form being placed under alower has lost its significance for self-consciousness, belongs toit only superficially and to its picture-thought. It is to be con-sidered in its proper significance only where it is the principleof this particular religion and is upheld by its actual Spirit. a.

Immediate existence sud-denly turns into thought, or mere sense-consciousness intoconsciousness of thought; and, moreover, because the thoughtstems from immediacy or is conditioned thought, it is not pureknowledge, but thought that is charged with otherness and is,therefore, the self-opposed thought of Good and Evil. Man ispictorially thought of in this way: that it once happened, withoutany necessity, that he lost the form of being at one with himselfthrough plucking the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of Goodand Evil, and was expelled from the state of innocence, fromNature which yielded its fruits without toil, and from Paradise,from the garden with its creatures."},{"number":776,"text":"Since this withdrawal into itself or self-centredness ofthe existent consciousness immediately makes it self-discordant,Evil appears as the primary existence of the inwardly-turnedconsciousness; and because the thoughts of Good and Evil areutterly opposed and this antithesis is not yet resolved, this con-sciousness is essentially only evil. But at the same time, onaccount of just this antithesis, there is also present the good con-sciousness opposing it, and their relation to each other. In sofar as immediate existence suddenly changes into Thought, andthe being-within-self is on the one hand itself a thinking, whileon the other hand the moment of the othering of essence is moreprecisely determined by it—{because of this double aspect] thebecoming of Evil can be shifted further back out of the existentworld even into the primary realm of Thought. It can thereforebe said that it is the very first-born Son of Light [Lucifer] him-self who fell because he withdrew into himself or, became self-centred, but that in his place another was at once created. Sucha form of expression as ‘fallen’ which, like the expression ‘Son’,belongs, moreover, to picture-thinking and not to the Notion,degrades the moments of the Notion to the level of picture-thinking or carries picture-thinking over into the realm ofthought. Likewise it makes no difference if we co-ordinate amultiplicity of other shapes with the simple thought of otherness THE REVEALED RELIGION 469 in the eternal Being and transfer the self-centredness into them.In fact, this co-ordination must be approved, since by meansofit this moment of otherness also expresses diversity, as it should;and, moreover, not as plurality in general, but also as a specificdiversity, so that one part, the Son, is that which is simple andknows itself to be essential Being, while the other part is thealienation, the externalization of being-for-self which lives onlyto praise that Being; to this part, then, can be assigned the tak-ing back again of the externalized being-for-self and the with-drawal into self of the evil principle. In so far as the othernessfalls into two parts, Spirit might, as regards its moments—ifthese are to be counted—be more exactly expressed as a qua-ternity in unity or, because the quantity itself again falls intotwo parts, viz. one part which has remained good and the otherwhich has become evil, might even be expressed as a five-in-one. But to count the moments can be reckoned as altogetheruseless, since in the first place what is differentiated is itself justas much only one thing—viz. the thought of the difference whichis only one thought—as it [the differentiated] is this differenti-ated element, the second relatively to the first. And, secondly,it is useless to count because the thought which grasps the Manyina One must be dissolved out of its universality and differenti-ated into more than three or four distinct components; and thisuniversality appears, in contrast to the absolute determinate-ness of the abstract unit, the principle of number, as indeter-minateness with respect to number as such, so that we couldspeak only of numbers in general, i.e. not of a specific numberof differences.

In accordance with this moment, ittherefore comes to pass that, just as Evil is nothing other than 470 C. (CC.) RELIGION the self-centredness of the natural existence of Spirit, so, con-versely, Good enters into actuality and appears as an existentself-consciousness. That which in the pure thought of Spirit isin general merely hinted at as the othering of the divine Being,here comes nearer to its realization for picture-thinking: thisrealization consists for picture-thinking in the self-abasementof the divine Being who renounces his abstract and non-actualnature. Picture-thinking takes the other aspect, evil, to be ahappening alien to the divine Being; to grasp it in the divineBeing itself as the wrath of God, this demands from picture-think-ing, struggling against its limitations, its supreme and moststrenuous effort, an effort which, since it lacks the Notion,remains fruitless."},{"number":778,"text":"The alienation of the divine Being is thus made explicitin its twofold form: the Self of Spirit and its simple thoughtare the two moments whose absolute unity is Spirit itself.

For then they are, as specificNotions, only in the relation of an antithesis; as independent,on the other hand, they have their essentiality outside of theirantithesis. Their movement is, therefore, their own free andspontaneous movement. As, then, the movement of the twosides is an intrinsic movement, since it is to be considered in thesides themselves, it is initiated by that side which is determinedas possessing being-in-itself as contrasted with the other. This THE REVEALED RELIGION 471 is depicted as a spontaneous act; but the necessity for its exter-nalization lies in the Notion that being-in-itself, which is so de-termined in the antithesis, has just for that reason no genuinesubsistence. It is, therefore, that side which has not being-for-self but simple being as its essence that alienates itself from itself,yields to death, and thereby reconciles absolute essence withitself. For, in this movement, it manifests itselfas Spirit ; abstractessence is alienated from itself, it has natural existence and self-like actuality ; this its otherness, or its sensuous presence, is takenback again by the second othering and posited as superseded,as universal. The [absolute] essence has thereby come to be itsown Self in its sensuous presence; the immediate existence ofactuality has ceased to be something alien and external for theabsolute essence, since that existence is superseded, is universal.This death is, therefore, its resurrection as Spirit."},{"number":780,"text":"The transcended immediate presence of the self-con-scious essence has the form of universal self-consciousness. ThisNotion of the transcended individual self that is absolute Beingimmediately expresses, therefore, the establishing of a com-munity which, tarrying hitherto in the sphere of picture-think-ing, now returns into itself as the Self; and in doing this, Spiritpasses over from the second element constituting it, i.e. frompicture-thinking, into the third element, self-consciousness assuch. If we further consider the behaviour of picture-thinkingin its progress, we find first of all the declaration that the divineBeing takes on human nature. Here it is already asserted thatin themselves the two are not separate; likewise in the declarationthat the divine Being from the beginning externalizes itself, thatits existence withdraws into itself and becomes self-centred andevil, implies, though it does not expressly assert, that this evilexistence is not in itself something alien to the divine Being.Absolute Being would be but an empty name if in truth therewere for it an ‘other’, if there were a ‘fall’ from it; on the con-trary, the moment of being-within-self constitutes the essentialmoment of the Self of Spirit. That this being-within-self and theactuality which follows from it belong to absolute Being itself,this which for us is Notion, and in so far as it is Notion, appearsto the picture-thinking consciousness as an incomprehensiblehappening; the in-itself assumes for it the form of indifferent being.The thought that those moments of absolute Being and of the 472 C. (CC.) RELIGION self-centred Self which seem to flee from each other are notseparate, also appears in this picture-thinking—tor it does pos-sess the true content—but this picture-thought comes later, inthe externalization of the divine Being who is made flesh. Thepicture-thought is in this way still immediate, and therefore notspiritual, i.e. it knows the human form of the divine Being atfirst only as a particular, not yet as a universal, form; it be-comes spiritual for this consciousness in the movement wherebythis divine Being in human shape sacrifices his immediateexistenceagainandreturns tothedivine Being: only when essenceis reflected into itself is it Spirit. In this picture-thought thereis depicted the reconciliation of the divine Being with its ‘other’in general, and specifically with the thought of it—Evil. Ifthis reconciliation is notionally expressed by saying that it con-sists in the fact that Evil is in itself the same as Goodness, oragain that the divine Being is the same as Nature in its wholeextent, or that Nature separated from the divine Being is simplynothing—we must regard this as an unspiritual way of talkingand one that is necessarily bound to give rise to misunderstand-ings. If Evil is the'same as Goodness, then Evil is just not Evil,nor Goodness Good: on the contrary, both are suspendedmoments—Evil in general is self-centred being-for-self, andGoodness is what is simple and without a self. When thusexpressed in terms.of their Notion, their unity is at once evident;for self-centred being-for-self is simple knowing, and simple[being] that lacks a Self is equally pure self-centred being-forself. If, therefore, it must be said, that according to this theirNotion, Good and Evil, i.e. in so far as they are not Good andEvil, are the same, it must also no less emphatically be assertedthat they are not the same, but are utterly different; for simplebeing-for-self, or pure knowing too, is each in its own selfequally pure negativity or absolute difference. The whole isonly complete when the two propositions are made together,and when the first is asserted and maintained, it must becountered by clinging to the other with invincible stubbornness.Since both are equally right, they are both equally wrong, andthe mistake consists in taking such abstract forms as ‘the same’and ‘not the same’, ‘identity’ and ‘non-identity’, to be some-thing true, fixed, and actual, and in resting on them. Neitherthe one nor the other has truth; the truth is just their movement THE REVEALED RELIGION 473 in which simple sameness is an abstraction and hence absolutedifference, but this, as difference in itself, is distinguished fromitself and is therefore selfsameness. This is precisely the case withthe ‘selfsameness’ of the divine Being and Nature in general,and human nature in particular: the former is Nature in so faras it is not essential Being, and the latter is divine accordingto its essence. But it is Spirit in which the truth of these twoabstract sides is made explicit, viz. by reducing them tosuspended moments, an explication which cannot be expressedby the judgement and the lifeless ‘is’ which forms its copula.Similarly, Nature is nothing apart from its essence ; but this same‘nothing’ just as much 35; it is an absolute abstraction, and thuspure thought or being-within-self, and with the moment of itsantithesis to the spiritual unity it is Evil. The difficulty that isfound in these Notions stems solely from clinging to the ‘is’ andforgetting the thinking of the Notions in which the momentsjust as much are as they are not—are only the movement whichis Spirit. It is this spiritual unity, or the unity in which the dif-ferences are present only as moments or as suspended, whichhas become explicit for the picture-thinking consciousness inthat reconciliation spoken of above; and since this unity is theuniversality of self-consciousness, self-consciousness has ceasedto think in pictures: the movement has returned into self-con-sciousness. _ 781. Spirit is thus posited in the third element, in universalself-consciousness ; it is its community. The movement of the com-munity as self-consciousness that has distinguished itself fromits picture-thought is to make explicit what has been implicitlyestablished. The dead divine Man or human God is in himselfthe universal self-consciousness ; this he has to become explicitlyfor this self-consciousness. Or, since this self-consciousness con-stitutes one side of the antithesis in picture-thought, viz. theside of evil, for which natural existence and individual self-con-sciousness count as essence—this side which is pictured as inde-pendent, not yet as a moment, has on account of its indepen-dence to raise itself through its own nature to Spirit, i.e. it hasto exhibit in its own self the movement of Spirit."},{"number":782,"text":"This self-consciousness is natural Spirit; the self has towithdraw from this natural existence and retreat into itself,which would mean, to become evil.

For the consciousness thatthinks in pictures the world has actually become, and is, evil,and the propitiation of the absolute Being was a real event;but in self-consciousness as such, what is thus pictured ashappening, as an event, has as regards its form the significanceonly of a suspended moment, for the self is the negative andhence a knowing—a knowing that is a pure act within con-sciousness itself. This moment of the negative must likewiseexpress itselfin the content. That is to say, since absolute Beingis already reconciled with itself in itself and is a spiritual unityin which the parts of the picture-thought are suspended or aremoments, what is expressed in the content is that each part ofthe picture-thought here receives the opposite meaning to whatit had before; each meaning thereby completes itself in theother, and only through this self-completion is the content aspiritual one ; since the determinateness is just as much its oppo-site, unity in otherness, i.e. the spiritual relationship, is anaccomplished fact: just as the opposite meanings were unitedpreviously for us, or in themselves, and even the abstract formsof‘the same’ and ‘not the same’, of ‘identity’ and ‘non-identity’were reduced to moments."},{"number":783,"text":"If, then, in the picture-thinking consciousness the in-wardizing of natural self-consciousness was the real existence ofevil, that inwardizing in the element of self-consciousness is theknowledge of evil as something that is implicit in existence. Thisknowledge is, of course, a genesis of evil, but only a genesis ofthe thought of evil, and is therefore recognized as the firstmoment of reconciliation. For as a withdrawal into itself fromthe immediacy of Nature which is determined as evil, it is aforsaking of that immediacy and a dying away of sin. It is notnatural existence as such that is forsaken by consciousness, butnatural existence that is at the same time known as evil. Theimmediate movement of withdrawal into self is just as much amediated movement; it presupposes itself, or is its own ground:that is to say, the ground of the withdrawal into self is thatNature has already withdrawn into itself; on account of evil,man must withdraw into himself; but evil is itself the with-drawal into self. This first movementis for that very reason onlyimmediate, or the simple Notion of that movement, because it THE REVEALED RELIGION 475 is the same as what its ground is.

Com-prehension is, therefore, for that self-consciousness not a grasp-ing of this Notion which knows superseded natural existenceto be universal and therefore reconciled with itself; but rathera grasping of the imaginative idea, that by bringing to pass itsown externalization, in its historical incarnation and death, thedivine Being has been reconciled with its [natural] existence.The grasping of this idea now expresses more definitely whatwas previously called the spiritual resurrection in this same con-text, i.e. the coming into existence of God’s individual self-con-sciousness as a universal self-consciousness, or as the religiouscommunity. The death of the divine Man, as death, is abstractnegativity, the immediate result of the movement which endsonly in natural universality. Death loses this natural meaningin spiritual self-consciousness, i.e. it comes to be its just statedNotion ; death becomes transfigured from its immediate mean-ing, viz. the non-being of this particular individual, into the uni-versality of the Spirit who dwells in His community, dies in itevery day, and is daily resurrected."},{"number":785,"text":"Thus what belongs to the element of picture-thinking, viz.that absolute Spirit gua individual, or rather gua particular,Spirit, presents the nature of Spirit in its [natural] existence,is here shifted into self-consciousness itself, into knowledge thatpreserves itselfin its otherness.

The immediately preceding ele-ment of picture-thinking is, therefore, here explicitly set aside,or it has returned into the Self, into its Notion; what was inthe former merely in the elementofbeinghas become a Subject. 476 C. (CC.) RELIGION By this very fact, the first element too, pure thinking and theeternal Spirit therein, is no longer beyond the picturing con-sciousness or beyond the Self; on the contrary, the return intoitself of the whole is just this, to contain within itself all themoments. The death of the Mediator as grasped by the Selfis the supersession of his objective existence or his particularbeing-for-self: this particular being-for-self has become a uni-versal self-consciousness. On the other side, the universal hasbecome self-consciousness, just because of this, and the pure ornon-actual Spirit of mere thinking has become actual.

For the Mediator, in so far as his death has notyet completed the reconciliation, is the one-sidedness whichtakes as essential Being the simple element of thought in contrastto actuality: this one-sided extreme of the Self does not as yethave equal worth with essential Being; this it first has as Spirit.The death of this picture-thought contains, therefore, at thesame time the death of the abstraction of the divine Being whichis not posited as Self. That death is the painful feeling of theUnhappy Consciousness that God Himself is dead. This hard say-ing is the expression of innermost simple self-knowledge, thereturn of consciousness into the depths of the night in which‘l’=‘T’, a night which no longer distinguishes or knows any-thing outside of it. This feeling is, in fact, the loss of substanceand of its appearance over against consciousness; but it is atthe same time the pure subjectivity of substance, or the purecertainty of itself which it lacked when it was object, or the im-mediate, or pure essence.

The community also does not possess theconsciousness of what itis ; itis spiritual self-consciousness whichis not an object to itself as this self-consciousness, or which doesnot unfold itself to a consciousness of itself; but rather, in so faras it is consciousness, it has those picture-thoughts which wehave considered. We see self-consciousness at its last turning-point become inward to itself and attain to a knowledge of its in-wardness; we see it divest itself of its natural existence andacquire pure negativity. But the positive meaning, viz. that thisnegativity or pure inwardness of knowledge is just as much theself-identical essence—or in other words, that -substance hashere succeeded in becoming absolute self-consciousness—thisis an ‘other’ for the devotional consciousness. It grasps thisaspect, viz. that the pure inwardization of knowledge is in itselfabsolute simplicity or substance, as the picture-thought ofsomething which is so, not in virtue of its Notion, but as thedeed of an alien satisfaction. In other words, it does not graspthe fact that this depth of the pure Self is the power by whichthe abstract divine Being is drawn down from its abstraction and 478 C. (CC.) RELIGION raised to a Self by the power of this pure devotion. The actionof the Self retains towards it this negative meaning because theexternalization, the kenosis of substance, is taken by the Selfto be an action implicit in the nature of substance; the Selfdoes not grasp and truly comprehend it, or does not find it inits own action as such. This unity of essence and the Self havingbeen implicitly achieved, consciousness, too, still has this picture-thought of its reconciliation, but as a picture-theught. It obtainssatisfaction by externally attaching to its pure negativity the posi-tive meaning of the unity of itself with the essential Being; itssatisfaction thus itself remains burdened with the antithesis ofa beyond. Its own reconciliation therefore enters its conscious-ness as something distant, as something in the distant future, justas the reconciliation which the other Self achieved appears assomething in the distant past. Just as the individual divine Manhas a father in principle and only an actual mother, so too theuniversal divine Man, the community, has for its father its owndoing and knowing, but for its mother, eternal love which itonly feels, but does not behold in its consciousness as an actual,immediate object. Its reconciliation, therefore, is in its heart, butits consciousness is still divided against itselfand its actual worldis still disrupted. What enters its consciousness as the in-itself,or the side of pure mediation, is a reconciliation that lies in thebeyond: but what enters it as present, as the side of immediacyand existence, is the world which has still to await its transfigura-tion. The world is indeed implicitly reconciled with the divineBeing; and regarding the divine Being it is known, of course,that it recognizes the object as no longer alienated from it butas identical with it in its love. But for self-consciousness, thisimmediate presence still has not the shape of Spirit. The Spiritof the community is thus in its immediate consciousness dividedfrom its religious consciousness, which declares, it is true, thatin themselves they are not divided, but this merely implicit unity is not realized, or has not yet become an equally absolute being-for-self.

ABSOLUTE KNOWING"},{"number":788,"text":"The Spirit of the revealed religion has not yet sur-mounted its consciousness as such, or what is the same, its actualself-consciousness is not the object of its consciousness; Spirititselfas a whole, and the self-differentiated moments within it,fall within the sphere of picture-thinking and in the form ofobjectivity. The content of this picture-thinking is absoluteSpirit; and all that now remains to be done is to supersede thismere form, or rather, since this belongs to consciousness as such,its truth must already have yielded itself in the shape of con-sciousness. This surmounting of the object of consciousness isnot to be taken one-sidedly to mean that the object showed itselfas returning into the Self, but is to be taken more specificallyto mean not only that the object as such presented itself to theSelfas vanishing, but rather that it is the externalization of self-consciousness that posits the thinghood [of the object] and thatthis externalization has not merely a negative but a positivemeaning, a meaning which is not only for us or in itself, butfor self-consciousness itself. The negative of the object, or itsself-supersession, has a positive meaning for self-consciousness,i.e. self-consciousness knows the nothingness of the object, onthe one hand, because it externalizes its own self—for in thisexternalization it posits itself as object, or the object as itself,in virtue of the indivisible unity of being-for-self. On the otherhand, this positing at the same time contains the other moment,viz. that self-consciousness has equally superseded this external-ization and objectivity too, and taken it back into itself so thatit is in communion with itself in its otherness as such. This isthe movement of consciousness, and in that movement conscious-ness is the totality of its moments. Equally, consciousness musthave related itself to the object in accordance with the totalityof the latter’s determinations and have thus grasped it from thestandpoint of each of them. This totality of its determinationsestablishes the object as an implicitly spiritual being, and it does 480 C. (DD.) ABSOLUTE KNOWING truly become a spiritual being for consciousness when each ofits individual determinations is grasped as a determination ofthe Self, or through the spiritual relationship to them that wasjust mentioned."},{"number":789,"text":"Thus the object is in part immediate being or, in general,a Thing—corresponding to immediate consciousness ; in part,an othering of itself, its relationship or being-for-an-other, andbeing-for-itself, i.e. determinateness—corresponding to percep-tion; and in part essence, or in the form of a universal—corre-sponding to the Understanding. It is, as a totality, a syllogismor the movement of the universal through determination to in-dividuality, as also the reverse movement from individualitythrough superseded individuality, or through determination,to the universal. It is, therefore, in accordance with these threedeterminations that consciousness must know the object asitself. However, this Knowing of which we are speaking is notKnowing as pure comprehension of the object [i.e. in terms ofthe Notion]; here, this Knowing is to be indicated only in itsprocess of coming-to-be, or in the moments of that aspect ofit which belongs to consciousness as such, the moments of theNotion proper or of pure Knowing in the form of shapes of con-sciousness. For this reason the object does not yet appear in con-sciousness as such as the spiritual essentiality we have justaffirmed it to be; and the relationship of consciousness to it isnot the consideration of it in this totality as such nor in its pureform as Notion; but it is from one side a shape of consciousnessas such, and from the other side a number of such shapes whichwe bring together, in which the totality of the moments of theobject and of the relation of consciousness to it can be indicatedonly as resolved into its moments."},{"number":790,"text":"For this aspect of the apprehension of the object, i.e.as it exists in the shape of consciousness, we have only to recallthe earlier shapes of consciousness already encountered. Thus,in regard to the object so far as it is an immediacy, ie. is anindifferent being, we saw Observing Reason seeking and findingitself in this indifferent thing, i.e. we saw it equally consciousofits action being external to it, as it was conscious of the objectonly as an immediate object. And we saw Observing Reasonat its peak express its specific character in the infinite judgementthat the being of the ‘I’ is a Thing, and, moreover, a sensuous ABSOLUTE KNOWING 481 immediate Thing. When the ‘T’ is called soul, it is true that itis also represented as a Thing, but as something invisible, in-tangible, etc., and therefore in fact not as an immediate beingand not as what is meant by a Thing. That judgement, takenjust as it stands, is non-spiritual or rather is the non-spiritualitself.

This moment manifested itself for consciousness in pure in-sight and enlightenment. Things are simply useful and to be con-sidered only from the standpoint of utility. The cultivated self-consciousness which has traversed the world of self-alienatedSpirit has, through its self-alienation, produced the Thing asits own self; therefore, it still retains its own selfin it and knowsthat the Thing lacks self-subsistence, that it is essentially onlya being-for-an-other ; or, to give complete expression to the rela-tionship, i.e., to what alone constitutes the nature of the objecthere, the Thing counts for it as something that exists on its ownaccount; it declares sense-certainty to be absolute truth, but thisbeing-for-self is itself declared to be a moment that merelyvanishes and passes over into its opposite, into a being that isat the disposal of an ‘other’."},{"number":792,"text":"However, at this stage, knowledge of the Thing is stillnot complete; it must be known not only from the standpointof the immediacy of being and of determinateness, but also asessence or inner being, as Self. This occurs in moral self-consciousness.This is aware that its knowledge is a knowledge of what is abso-lutely essential, it knows that being is simply and solely pure wil-ling and knowing; it is nothing else but this willing and know-ing; anything else has only unessential being, i.e. not, intrinsicbeing, only its empty husk. In the same measure that moralself-consciousness lets determinate being go free from the Self, sotoo, in its conception of the world it takes it back again intoitself. Finally, as conscience, it is no longer this continualalternation of existence being placed in the Self, and vice versa;it knows that its existence as such is this pure certainty of itself.The objective element into which it puts itself forth, when 482 C. XDD.)

The lastof these moments is, however, necessarily this unity itself and,as is evident, it binds them all into itself. The Spirit that, inits.existence, is certain of itself, has for the element of existencenothing else but this knowledge of itself; when it declares thatwhat it does it does out of a conviction of duty, this utteranceis the validating of its action. Action is the first implicit sunderingofthesimpleunity of the Notionand the return out of this divided-ness. This first movement changes round into the second, sincethis element of recognition posits itself, as simple knowledge ofduty, in antithesis to the distinction and dichotomy that lie inaction as such and so constitute a stubborn actuality confront-ing action. But in forgiveness, we saw how this obstinacy sur-renders and renounces itself. Here, therefore, actuality as wellas immediate existence has for self-consciousness no other sig-nificance than that of being a pure knowing; similarly,as determinate existence or as relation, what is self-opposedis a knowing, partly of this purely individual Self, partly ofknowledge as universal. In this is posited at the same timethat the third moment, the universality or essence, counts only asknowledge for each of the two sides that stand over againsteach other; and finally these latter equally resolve the emptyantithesis still remaining and are the knowledge of ‘I’?=‘I’;this individual Self which is immediately a pure knowing or auniversal."},{"number":794,"text":"Thisreconciliation of consciousness with self-conscious-ness thus shows itself as brought about from two sides; on oneside, in the religious Spirit, and on the other side, in conscious-ness itself as such. The difference between them is that in theformer this reconciliation is in the form of being-in-ztself orimplicit being, and in the latter in the explicit form of being-for-self. In our consideration of them they at first fall apart. Inthe other in which the shapes of consciousness came before us,consciousness reached the individual moments of those shapesand their unification long before ever religion gave its object ABSOLUTE KNOWING 483 the shape of actual self-consciousness. The unification of the twosides has not yet been exhibited; it is this that closes the seriesof the shapes of Spirit, for in it Spirit attains to a knowledgeofitselfnot only as it is in itself or as possessing an absolute content,tior only as it is for itself as a form devoid of content, or as theaspect of self-consciousness, but as it is both in essence and in actu-ality, or in and for itself."},{"number":795,"text":"This unification has, however, already occurred in prin-ciple and that, too, in religion, in the return of picture-thinkinginto self-consciousness, but not according to the proper form,for the religious aspect is the aspect of the in-itself which standsover against the movement of self-consciousness. Consequently,the unification belongs to this other aspect which, in the con-trast of the two sides, is the aspect of reflection into self, andtherefore the one that contains both its own self and its opposite,and not only implicitly or in a universal sense, but explicitly orin a developed and differentiated way. The content, as well asthe other aspect of self-conscious Spirit so far as it is theother aspect, has been exhibited and is before us in its com-pleteness ; the unification that is still lacking is the simple unityof the Notion. The Notion, too, is itself already present on theside of self-consciousness. But as it has come before us thus far,it-has to be a particular shape of consciousness like all the othermoments. It is, therefore, that aspect of the shape of self-assuredSpirit that abides within its Notion and was called the ‘beautifulsoul’. The ‘beautiful soul’ is its own knowledge of itself in itspure, transparent unity—the self-consciousness that knows thispure knowledge of pure inwardness as Spirit. It is not only theintuition of the Divine but the Divine’s intuition of itself. Sincethis Notion holds itself firmly opposed to its realization, it isthe one-sided shape which we saw vanish into thin air, but alsopositively externalize itself and move onward. Through thisrealization, this objectless self-consciousness ceases to cling tothe determinateness of the Notion as against its fulfilment; its self-consciousness gains the form of universality and what remainsto itis its true Notion, or the Notion that has attained its realiza-tion; it is the Notion in its truth, viz. in unity with its external-ization ; it is the knowing of pure knowledge, not as an abstractessence such as duty is, but of knowledge as an essential beingwhich is this knowledge, this pure self-consciousness which is, 484 C. (DD.) ABSOLUTE KNOWING therefore, at the same time a genuine object, for the Notion isthe Self that is for itself."},{"number":796,"text":"This Notion fulfilled itselfon one side in the self-assuredSpirit that acted, and on the other, in religion: in religion it wonfor consciousness the absolute content as content or, in the formof picture-thinking, the form of otherness for consciousness; onthe other hand, in the prior shape the form is that of the Selfitself, for it contains the self-assured Spirit that acts; the Selfaccomplishes the life of absolute Spirit. This shape is, as we haveseen, that simple Notion which, however, surrenders its eternalessence, it is there [in the real world], or it acts. The sel/-sunderingor stepping-forth into existence stems from the purity of theNotion, for this is absolute abstraction or negativity. Similarly,the Notion gets the element of its actuality or the being it con-tains in pure knowledge itself, for this is simple immediacy, whichis as much being and existence as it is essence; the former, nega-tive thought, the latter, positive thought itself. Finally, this ex-istence, both as existence and as duty, is just as much the reflec-tedness into self out of pure knowledge-—or the state of evil.This withdrawal intoitselfconstitutes the antithesis of the Notion,and is thus the emergence of the pure knowledge of the essence,the knowing that does not act and is not actual. But this emergencein the antithesis is participation in it; the pure knowledge ofessence has in principle renounced its simple unity, for it is theself-sundering, or the negativity which the Notion is; so far asthis self-sundering is the process of becoming for itself, it is evil;so far as it is the in-itself, it remains good. Now, what at firsthappens in principle is at the same time explicitly for constious-ness, and is thus double: it is both for consciousness and also isits being-for-self or its very own act. The same thing that isalready posited in principle now therefore repeats itself as con-sciousness’s knowledge of it and conscious act. Each in relationto the other lets go of the independent determinateness withwhich it comes forth against it.. This letting-go is the samerenunciation of the one-sidedness of the Notion that in itselfconstituted the beginning; but it is now its own act of renuncia-tion, just as the Notion which it renounces is its own Notion.That in-itself [i.e. the immediacy] of the beginning is in truth,as negativity, no less mediated; what it is in truth, it now alsomakes explicit, and the negative is, as determinateness of each both ABSOLUTE KNOWING 485 for the other and in itself, self-suspending. One of the two partsof the antithesis is the disparity between the Notion’s beingwithin itself in its individuality, and universality; the other, thedisparity between its abstract universality and the Self. Theformer dies to its being-for-self, disowns itself, makes confession ;the latter renounces the obstinacy of its abstract universality,and in so doing dies to its lifeless Self and to its unmoved uni-versality; the former has thus completed itself through themomentof universality which is essence, and the latter throughthe universality which is Self. Through this movement of action,Spirit has come on the scene as a pure universality of knowing,which is self-consciousness, as self-consciousness that is thesimple unity of knowing. It is only through action that Spiritis in such a way that it is really there, that is, when it raises itsexistence into Thought and thereby into an absolute antithesis,and returns out of this antithesis, in and through the antithesisitself."},{"number":797,"text":"Thus, what in religion was content or a form for present-ing an other, is here the Self’s own act; the Notion requires thecontent to be the Self’s own act. For this Notion is, as we see,the knowledge of the Self’s act within itself as all essentialityand all existence, the knowledge of this subject as substanceand of the substance as this knowledge of its act. Our own acthere has been simply to gather together the separate moments,each of which in principle exhibits the life of Spirit in its en-tirety, and also to stick to the Notion in the form of the Notion,the content of which would already have yielded itself in thosemoments and in the form of a shape of consciousness."},{"number":798,"text":"This last shape of Spirit—the Spirit which at the sametime gives its complete and true content the form of the Selfand thereby realizes its Notion as remaining in its Notion inthis realization—this is absolute knowing; it is Spirit that knowsitself in the shape of Spirit, or a comprehensive knowing [in termsof the Notion]. Truth is not only in itself completely identicalwith certainty, but it also has the shape of self-certainty, or itis in its existence in the form of self-knowledge. Truth is thecontent, which in religion is still not identical with its certainty.But this identity is now a fact, in that the content has receivedthe shape of the Self. As a result, that which is the very essence,viz. the Notion, has become the element of existence, or has 486 C. (DD.) ABSOLUTE KNOWING become the form of objectivity for consciousness. Spirit, manifestingor appearing in consciousness in this element, or what is the samething, produced in it by consciousness, is Science."},{"number":799,"text":"The nature, moments and movement of this knowinghave, then, shown themselves to be such that this knowing is apure being-for-self of self-consciousness ; it is ‘I’, that is this and noother ‘I’, and which is no less immediately a mediated or super-seded universal ‘I’. It has a content which it differentiates from itself;for it is pure negativity or the dividing of itself, it is consciousness.This content is, in its difference, itself the ‘I’, for it is the move-ment of superseding itself, or the same pure negativity that the‘T is. In it, as differentiated, the ‘I’ is reflected into itself; itis only when the ‘I’ communes with itself in its otherness thatthe content is comprehended [i.e. in terms of the Notion]. Statedmore specifically, this content is nothing else than the verymovement just spoken of; for the content is Spirit that traversesits own self and does so for itself as Spirit by the fact that it hasthe ‘shape’ of the Notion in its objectivity."},{"number":800,"text":"But as regards the existence of this Notion, Science doesnot appear in Time and in the actual world before Spirit hasattained to this consciousness about itself.

For sub-stance is the as yet undeveloped in-itself, or the Ground andNotion in its still unmoved simplicity, and therefore the inward-ness or the Self of the Spirit that does not yet exist. What is there,exists as the still undeveloped simple and immediate, or as theobject of the picture-thinking consciousness in general. Cognition,because it is the spiritual consciousness for which what is in itselfonly zs, in so far as it is a being for the Self and a being of theSelf or Notion, has for this reason at first only a meagre object,in contrast with which substance and the consciousness of this ABSOLUTE KNOWING 487 substance are richer. The disclosure or revelation which sub-stance has in this consciousness is in fact concealment, for sub-stance is still self-less being and what is disclosed to it is only thecertainty of itself. At first, therefore, only the abstract momentsof substance belong to self-consciousness; but since these, aspure movements, spontaneously impel themselves onward, self-consciousness enriches itself till it has wrested from conscious-ness the entire substance and has absorbed into itself the entirestructure of the essentialities of substance. And, since this nega-tive attitude to objectivity is just as much positive, it is a posit-ing, it has produced them out of itself, and in so doing has atthe same time restored them for consciousness. In the Notionthat knows itself as Notion, the moments thus appear earlier thanthe filled [or fulfilled] whole whose coming-to-be is the movementof those moments. In consciousness, on the other hand, the whole,though uncomprehended, is prior to the moments. Time is theNotion itself that is there and which presents itself to conscious-ness as empty intuition; for this reason, Spirit necessarilyappears in Time, and it appears in Time just so long as it hasnot grasped its pure Notion, i.e. has not annulled Time. It isthe outer, intuited pure Self which is not grasped by the Self, themerely intuited Notion; when this latter grasps itself it sets asideits Time-form, comprehends this intuiting, and is a compre-hended and comprehending intuiting. Time, therefore, appearsas the destiny and necessity of Spirit that is not yet completewithin itself, the necessity to enrich the share which self-con-sciousness has in consciousness, to set in motion the immediacyof the in-itself, which is the form in which substance is presentin consciousness; or conversely, to realize and reveal what isat first only inward (the in-itself being taken as what is inward),i.e. to vindicate it for Spirit’s certainty of itself."},{"number":802,"text":"For this reason it must be said that nothing is knownthat is not in experience, or, as it is also expressed, that is notfelt to be true, not given as an inwardly revealed eternal verity, assomething sacred that is believed, or whatever other expressionshave been used. For experience is just this, that the content—which is Spirit—is in itself substance, and therefore an objectof consciousness. But this substance which is Spirit is the processin which Spirit becomes what it is in itself; and it is only as thisprocess of reflecting itself into itself that it is in itself truly Spirit. 488 C. (DD.) ABSOLUTE KNOWING Itisinitself the movement which is cognition—the transform-ing of that in-itself into that which is for itself, of Substance intoSubject, of the object of consciousness into an object of self-con-sciousness, i.e. into an object that is just as much superseded,or into the Notion. The movement is the circle that returns intoitself, the circle that presupposes its beginning and reaches itonly at the end. Hence, so far as Spirit is necessarily thisimmanent differentiation, its intuited whole appears overagainst its simple self-consciousness, and since, then, the formeris whatis differentiated, it is differentiated into its intuited pureNotion, into Time and into the content or into the in-itself. Sub-stance is charged, as Subject, with the at first only inward neces-sity of setting forth within itself what it is in itself, of exhibitingitself as Spirit. Only when the objective presentation is completeis it at the same time the reflection of substance or the processin which substance becomes Self. Consequently, until Spirit hascompleted itself in itself, until it has completed itself as world-Spirit, it cannot reach its consummation as self-conscious Spirit.Therefore, the content of religion proclaims earlier in timethan does Science, what Spirit is, but only Science is its trueknowledge of itself."},{"number":803,"text":"The movement of carrying forward the form of its self-knowledge is the labour which it accomplishes as actual His-tory. The religious community, so far as.it is at first the sub-stance of absolute Spirit, is the uncultivated consciousnesswhose existence is all the harsher and more barbarous thedeeper its inner Spirit is, and the deeper its Spirit is, the harderthe task that its torpid Self has with its essence, with the aliencontent ot its consciousness. Not until consciousness has givenup hope of overcoming that alienation in an external, i.e. alien,manner does it turn to itself, because the overcoming of thatalienation is the return into self-consciousness; not until thendoes it turn to its own present world and discover it as its prop-erty, thus taking the first step towards coming down out of theintellectual world, or rather towards quickening the abstract ele-ment of that world with the actual Self. Through Observationit finds, on the one hand, existence in the shape of Thoughtand comprehends it, and, conversely, in its thinking it compre-hends existence. When, to begin with, it has thus expressed theimmediate umty of Thought and Being, the unity of abstract ABSOLUTE KNOWING 489 essence and the Self, abstractly ; and when it has expressed theprimal Light in a purer form, viz. as unity of extension andbeing—for extension is the simple unity which more nearlyresembles pure thought than light does—and in so doing hasrevived in thought the Substance of the Orient, Spirit at oncerecoils in horror from the abstract unity, from this self-less sub-stantiality, and against it affirms individuality. But only afterit has externalized this individuality in the sphere of culture,thereby giving it an existence, and establishing it throughoutthe whole of existence---only after Spirit has arrived at thethought of utility, and in its absolute freedom has grasped exist-ence as its will, only then does it turn the thought of its inmostdepths outwards and enunciate essence as ‘I’ =‘I’. But this ‘P =‘T’ is the movement which reflects itself into itself; for since thisidentity, being absolute negativity, is absolute difference, theself-identity of the ‘I’ stands over against this pure differencewhich, as pure and at the same time objective to the self-know-ing Self, has to be expressed as Time. So that, just as previouslyessence was declared to be the unity of Thought and Extension,it would now have to be grasped as the unity of Thought andTime. But the difference left to itself, unresting and unhaltingTime, collapses rather within itself; it is the objective reposeof extension, while extension is pure identity with itself, the ‘P.In other words, the ‘I’ is not merely the Self, but the identityof the Self with itself; but this identity is complete and immediateoneness with Self, or this Subject is just as much Substance. Sub-stance, just by itself, would be intuition devoid of content, orthe intuition of a content which, as determinate, would be onlyaccidental and would lack necessity. Substance would pass forthe Absolute only in so far as it was thought or intuited as abso-lute unity; and all content would, as regards its diversity, haveto fall outside of it into Reflection; and Reflection does not per-tain to Substance, because Substance would not be Subject,would not be grasped as reflecting on itself and reflecting itselfinto itself, would not be grasped as Spirit. If a content wereto be spoken of anyway, it would, on the one hand, only bespoken of in order to cast it into the empty abyss of the Absolute,and on the other, it would be a content picked up in externalfashion from sense-perception. Knowledge would seem to havecome by things, by what is different from itself, and by the dif- 490 C. (DD.)

That first reflection out ofimmediacy is the Subject’s differentiation of itself from its sub-stance, or the Notion’s separation of itself from itself, the with-drawal into itself and the becoming of the pure ‘P. Since thisdifference is the pure act of ‘I’ =‘I’, the Notion is the necessityand the uprising of existence, which has substance for its essenceand subsists on its own account. But this subsistence of existenceon its own account is the Notion posited in determinateness andis thus also its immanent movement, that of going down into thesimple substance, which is Subject only as this negativity andmovement. The ‘T’ -has neither to cling to itself in the form ofself-consciousness as against the form of substantiality and objec-tivity, as if it were afraid of the externalization of itself: thepower of Spirit lies rather in remaining the selfsame Spiritin its externalization and, as that which is both in itself andfor itself, in making its being-for-self no less merely amoment than its in-itself; nor is Spirit a tertium quid that caststhe differences back into the abyss of the Absolute and declaresthat therein they are all the same; on the contrary, knowingis this seeming inactivity which merely contemplates how whatis differentiated spontaneously moves in its own self and returnsinto its unity."},{"number":805,"text":"In this knowing, then, Spirit has concluded the move-ment in which it has shaped itself, in so far as this shaping wasburdened with the difference of consciousness [i.e. of the latterfrom its object], a difference now overcome.

Spirit, therefore, having won the Notion, displaysits existence and movement in this ether of its life and is Science.In this, the moments of its movement no longer exhibit them-selves as specific shapes of consciousness, but—since consciousness’sdifference has returned into the Self—as specific Notions and astheir organic self-grounded movement. Whereas in the pheno-menology of Spirit each moment is the difference of knowledgeand Truth, and is the movement in which that difference iscancelled, Science on the other hand does not contain this dif-ference and the cancelling of it. On the contrary, since themoment has the form of the Notion, it unites the objective formof Truth and of the knowing Self in an immediate unity. Themoment does not appear as this movement of passing back andforth, from consciousness or picture-thinking into self-con-sciousness, and conversely: on the contrary, its pure shape,freed from its appearance in consciousness, the pure Notion andits onward movement, depends solely on its pure determinateness.Conversely, to each abstract moment of Science correspondsa shape of manifest Spirit as such. Just as Spirit in its existenceis not richer than Science, so too it is not poorer either in con-tent. Toknow the pure Notions of Science in this form of shapesof consciousness constitutes the side of their reality, in accord-ance with which their essence, the Notion, which is posited inthem in its simple mediation as thinking, breaks asunder themoments of this mediation and exhibits itself in accordancewith the inner antithesis."},{"number":806,"text":"Science contains within itself this necessity of externallizing the form of the Notion, and it contains the passage ofthe Notion into consciousness. For the self-knowing Spirit, justbecause it grasps its Notion, is the immediate identity with itselfwhich, in its difference, is the certainty of immediacy, or sense-con-sctousness—the beginning from which we started. This releaseof itself from the form of its Self is the supreme freedom andassurance of its self-knowledge."},{"number":807,"text":"Yet this externalization is still incomplete; it expressed 492 C. (DD.) ABSOLUTE KNOWING the connection of its self-certainty with the object which, justbecause it is thus connected, has not yet won its complete free-dom. The self-knowing Spirit knows not only itself but also thenegative of itself, or its limit: to know one’s limit is to knowhow to sacrifice oneself. This sacrifice is the externalization inwhich Spirit displays the process of its becoming Spirit in theform of free contingent happening, intuiting its pure Self as Timeoutside of it, and equally its Being as Space. This last becomingof Spirit, Nature, is its living immediate Becoming; Nature, theexternalized Spirit, is in its existence nothing but this eternalexternalization of its continuing existence and the movementwhich reinstates the Subject."},{"number":808,"text":"But the other side of its Becoming, History, is a conscious,self-mediating process—Spirit emptied out into Time; but thisexternalization, this kenosis, is equally an externalization ofitself; the negative is the negative of itself. This Becomingpresents a slow-moving succession of Spirits, a gallery of images,each of which, endowed with all the riches of Spirit, moves thusslowly just because the Self has to penetrate and digest thisentire wealth of its substance. As its fulfilment consists in per-fectly knowing what it is, in knowing its substance, this knowingis its withdrawal into itself in which it abandons its outer existenceand gives its existential shape over to recollection. Thusabsorbed in itself, it is sunk in the night of its self-consciousness ;but in that night its vanished outer existence is preserved, andthis transformed existence—the former one, but now reborn ofthe Spirit’s knowledge—is the new existence, a new world anda new shape of Spirit. In the immediacy of this new existencethe Spirit has to start afresh to bring itself to maturity as if,for it, all that preceded were lost and it had learned nothingfrom the experience of the earlier Spirits. But recollection, theinwardizing, of that experience, has preserved it and is the innerbeing, and in fact the higher form of the substance. Soalthough this Spirit starts afresh and apparently from its ownresources to bring itself to maturity, it is none the less on a higherlevel that it starts. The realm of Spirits which is formed in this.way in the outer world constitutes a succession in Time in whichone Spirit relieved another of its charge and each took over theempire of the world from its predecessor. Their goal is therevelation of the depth of Spirit, and this is the absolute Notion. ABSOLUTE KNOWING 493 This revelation is, therefore, the raising-up of its depth, or itsextension, the negativity of this withdrawn ‘I’, a negativity whichis its externalization or its substance; and this revelation is alsothe Notion’s Time, in that this externalization is in its own selfexternalized, and just as it is in its extension, so it is equallyin its depth, in the Self. The goal, Absolute Knowing, or Spiritthat knows itself as Spirit, has for its path the recollection otthe Spirits as they are in themselves and as they accomplishthe organization of their realm. Their preservation, regardedfrom the side of their free existence appearing in the form of con-tingency, is History; but regarded from the side of their [philo-sophically] comprehended organization, it is the Science ofKnowing in the sphere of appearance:! the two together, com-prehended History, form alike the inwardizing and the Calvaryof absolute Spirit, the actuality, truth, and certainty of histhrone, without which he would be lifeless and alone. Only from the chalice of this realm of spiritsfoams forth for Him his own infinitude.? 1 Phenomenology.2 Adaptation of Schiller’s Die Freundschaft, ad fin.
