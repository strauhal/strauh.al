      <p>

        today i have become so bored that i have decided to start a diary..;  currently stuck in some random suburb of illinois in my aunt and uncles basement and playing with this new drug my psychiatrist gave me called wellbutrin.  <br><br>

        i called walgreens today about my prescription and i could tell the person on the other end was getting fed up with how slow my brain was moving because of the drug.  <br><br>

        anyway, the reason i'm messing around with wellbutrin is because my psychiatrist diagnosed me with a whole grab bag of mental disorders.  <a href="diary/pp,504x498-pad,600x600,f8f8f8.u1.jpg">lol.</a>  in all honesty, i should have asked for something more fun like <a href="diary/ritalin.jpg">ritalin or adderall</a><br><br>

        i'm sure i'll probably forget about this journal in a week when i inevitably find something new to hyperfixate on <br><br>

        <p>

        it's 1:58 am so i guess i was eager to get this entry in.  just finished up a 2 hour vr session; i feel better now.  <br><br><a href="culture_society/247424134_4622366904474315_1086021457600591051_n.jpg">is it sad that i prefer virtual reality over actual reality?  i can't explain the feeling, but when i'm in the web browser on the headset, i feel disappointed that i am unable to be sucked entirely into the website.</a>  i guess this makes me cringe and bluepilled, but that's just how i feel.  <br><br>

        <a href="diary/3995203629_26fb31e2e2_z.jpg">my dream one of these days is that they'll figure out how to get rid of my body and just keep my brain hooked up to a computer.</a>  now, i sort of understand millennials when they complain about being "bags of meat on a hecking ball of dirt speeding through spacerino"

        had a panic attack inside of my dream last night.  pretty sure it's related to the wellbutrin.<br><br>

      <p>

        at this point i’ve gotten accustomed to wellbutrin so i am now able to pull off a pretty convincing fluoride stare <br><br>

        <a href="diary/54dfc0cbd9b761fb276b428b99dc9589.jpg">how do i feel when i’m on this drug? well, i no longer want to make art anymore. any creative impulses that were lingering in my brain have now been beaten out. i just stare at my fucking computer all day and do nothing. i wish i were dead </a><br><br>

        for the past 23 years, i have been a very reactive person. i would intake stimuli, and just react without being fully present in the moment. <a href="old_photos/oldphotos 50.png">i was like a raw nerve for two decades, and i was unknowingly taken advantage of by people for this reason.</a> <br><br>

        i feel like if i talk to other people about this they’ll say something like the only person you can blame is yourself. And they're right. it just feels so good to have someone or some thing to blame though. i have largely forgotten what has happened in those years .  <a href="https://strauh.al/more_fine_art/FzBluNCWYAE5dtT.jpeg">The main emotions i feel now are a mixture of shame and regret knowing that i have probably been a burden to everyone i’ve met in my life.</a><br><br>

        i’ve been taking the metra a lot recently. <a href="diary/hf_1_2021_06_16.jpg">there tends to be a large number of amish people that travel through the station. they look so quaint.</a> right now i’m looking at an amish family and the husband and wife are wearing these strange hats and the son is dressed up in a pair of adorable overalls. <br><br>

        i’m thinking that they probably have better mental health than most terminally online American people do. Maybe we should all be amish.

        <a href="diary/90.jpeg">thinking about this quote today:</a><br><br>

        “For the new year. – i’m still alive; i still think: i must still be alive because i still have to think. Sum, ergo cogito: cogito, ergo sum.1 Today everyone allows himself to express his dearest wish and thoughts: so i, too, want to say what i wish from myself today and what thought first crossed my heart – what thought shall be the reason, warrant, and sweetness of the rest of my life! i want to learn more and more how to see what is necessary in things as what is beautiful in them – thus i will be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati:2 let that be my love from now on! i do not want to wage war against ugliness. i do not want to accuse; i do not even want to accuse the accusers. Let looking away be my only negation! And, all in all and on the whole: some day i want only to be a Yes-sayer!”

        i was puzzled by this as our project didn't remotely have anything to do with "diversity and inclusion" ...;  apparently (according to their logic) americans will automatically favor projects that have those words;  hmmmmm... okay lol

        when i look back at all the music i made the past couple of years, i think 2022-early2023 was my slop era.  i would just take 15 second snippets of obscure songs and stretch them out to 6 minutes.  truly artistically bankrupt.  <a href="album_covers/thousand_knives.jpg">it wasn't until ryuichi sakamoto died that i realized i needed to put more effort into my music.</a>  <br><br>

        also i guess i should be more transparent to myself about the nature of this diary.  this is probably the first time in my life i've been able to keep up a journal for over a few weeks.  also, it's not like i'm writing this in a cute little moleskine book or anything, i'm writing this in html that will be hosted on a url for others to read if they have the link.  haven't really publicly or privately shared this with any people yet.  right now, it just feels like me and the internet.  <br><br>

        <a href="photography/couple.jpg">by that, i don't mean other people on the internet, i mean if the infrastructure powering the internet developed a consciousness, this diary would be a nice little secret that me and the internet would share.</a>

        also now that i think about it, that's probably the reason i gave up on starting a record label haha.  how can artists/musicians compete with an endless stream of entertainment that is tailored to the user?  i should have realized this well before i even started working on the webpage/bandcamp page for the label considering that tiktok was already around for a few years

        in the future, everyone will either be an uber driver, a doordasher or an onlyfans model.  perhaps a combination of those things all at once.  everyone will also be genderfluid / nonbinary as well.  this fluidity will extend to politics, sports, language, employment, art, music, sexuality, religion, nationality, and race too lol.  <br><br>

        i think that would be so based.  <a href="diary/laion-clusters.jpeg">each of these characteristics will be labeled as vector coordinates in some sort of latent space.  people will be able to see the distances they've covered in each dimension of the latent space and they'll be able to see their own trajectories in the future (along with everyone elses) through the space based on their current and past movement.</a>  <br><br>

        <a href="old_photos/oldphotos 16.png">i guess i should explain this picture before i suddenly develop dementia or something.</a><br><br>

        this picture was taken of me on the first day of kindergarten and this might also be the first drawing i’ve ever made.  the teacher had provided a bunch of coloring sheets for all the students and everyone was doing a great job of coloring inside the lines…   …except for me.  this isn’t a metaphor for anything by the way, my parents saw the wall of coloring sheets that were stapled to the wall and my drawing stood out from the rest, and not in a good way.<br><br>  

        apparently, i had wrapped all 5 of my pudgy fingers around a green crayon and took the coloring sheet to task.  whether the sheet of paper had any outlines on it didn't matter at all because i covered the entire thing with scribbles.  now that i think about it, that might be why my kindergarten teacher told my parents that i might have been autistic (or maybe because i was nonverbal for the first 5 years of my life hahah).<br><br>

        also this first art memory reminds me of my first memory of pain.  a year after kindergarten when i was in the first grade, my mother told me to doodle something on a piece of paper for a city wide drawing competition.  anyway, i probably made something in less than 30 minutes and went back to doing whatever it is that five year olds do.  <a href="old_photos/oldphotos 117.png">what i had not expected was that my drawing was chosen over every other first grader’s drawing in the school district.  i mean really, this was not a technically skilled drawing for a five year old, especially compared to my classmates who had probably spent more time doing better drawings.</a><br><br>  

        annyyyyywayyyyyy, i had received a ribbon as an award for this drawing which hung on the top shelf in my bedroom.  one night, i climbed up the shelf to grab the ribbon and was swishing the ribbon through the air by its string.  however, the string that was attached to the ribbon snagged on the doorknob and tore all of the skin off of my ring finger.  not fun<br><br>

        hopefully this entry sheds some light on an early moment that might have led me to become the self indulgent, egomaniac piece of shit "artist" i am today.  <br><br>

        <a href="diary/jacfast3.png">also, to create art requires love.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pain.</a><br><br>  

        something that these dork ass losers making ai art have probably never felt lol.

      	aunt asked me about my cousin today.  for reference, my cousin is trans which is causing a bit of confusion with my aunt.  i can tell my aunt was trying her best to understand that my cousin was a guy, but my aunt was oscillating between he and she as if my cousin were trapped in a superposition between being male and female.  at least my aunt is making an effort.  my parents watch too much fox news and they keep on referring to my cousin as she which might have been funny if i were an edgy high schooler but they’ve probably done that a couple dozen times by now.

		i feel like the whole trans thing is wrecking my aunt’s mind lol.  i’m also unable to talk about this with my girlfriend because she’ll either say “you talk about trans people a lot” or “are you trying to come out as trans?”

        **update (october 16th): i think i made this entry with my cousin stanley in mind.  i saw him when he was still in good health although his wife told me that he was going to be in a wheelchair in a few months because of ALS.  eventually he'll need to have a feeding tube.  <br><br>

        anyway, when i visited him and his family with my mother in new york last year, i thought it was gonna be pretty chill until my mom took a bible out of her purse and tried to christpill him.  to which he told my mother that a bunch of other aunts had tried to do the same.  his wife told me in another room that most people with ALS have 3 to 5 years to live after the diagnosis.

        randomly remembered something i saw a few miles away from my parent's home when i was back there in september.  i was wandering around in a large field and saw a shopping cart in the distance.  it felt very strange..;  it had a monumental quality about it., just sitting there by itself in the middle of this field.  and rightfully so.  the shopping cart is a uniquely american invention, for a uniquely american activity.  <br><br>

        also, perceptions of shopping carts can be very subjective.  what may be a negligible mode of transporting products or groceries for one person may be a vehicle filled with personal objects for another.<br><br>

        here's an excerpt from a wikipedia article about the early days of the shopping cart: <br><br>

        <i>The invention did not catch on immediately. Men found them effeminate; women found them suggestive of a baby carriage. "i've pushed my last baby buggy," offended women informed him. After hiring several male and female models to push his new invention around his store and demonstrate their utility, as well as greeters to explain their use, his folding-style shopping carts became extremely popular and Goldman became a multimillionaire by collecting a royalty on every folding design shopping cart in the United States.</i><br><br>

This was very strange to me, because i was just sitting around and we weren’t really doing anything:;,</a> there was basically no instruction going on. <br><br>

        anyway, perhaps she did that because she was upset that she couldn’t put me on ritalin after telling my mother that i might have ADHD. <a href="more_fine_art/tumblr_989687c381cdd655b835f3ab471c8494_33cf1a38_1280.jpg">i remember when i was placed in this particular teacher’s classroom, my mother was excited because this teacher had received the “teacher of the year award.”</a><br><br>

        this image blew up in popularity (47 million reposts) and soon these ai sloppers were arguing over who created this image first.  <a href="diary/noshitsherlock.jpg">social media activism was always a race to the bottom</a> but at least people were pretending to keep up the facade of actual effort by creating art or slides specifically for these issues.  <br><br>

        i still keep myself up to date on this stuff, but after 1 or 2 performative gestures on my end, i realized that i was being a bit cringe.  everyone already has come to a general consensus that "war bad.  genocide bad."  like everything else after that point is just for optics lol<br><br>

        reminds me of this quote:<br><br>

        I will finish, however, with a word about my own preferences. I get the keenest pleasure from drawings which are essentially spontaneous, in which there is the smallest time lag between the feeling-the desire-the ache to draw, and its expression. Drawings in which there has been no time for emotion to evaporate or run to seed in the sludge of some labourious technical style. Even in the brash bravura of Epstein or John there is much pleasure to be derived from the sheer immediacy and impact of spontaneity. But there are drawings in which only the merest tremble of line separates the emotion from its expression, and this is the drawing of the great masters. Into this category come the line drawings of Rodin, and those inexpressibly delicate and beautiful early studies of Picasso, such as the Deux Nus (41). There is here a distillation of emotion, so rare, so refined, a communication of spirit so bathed in poetry and compassion, so tender and moving, that the heart melts. There is no problem of communication here, nor the need of any further words from me.<br><br>

VIVA LA VIDA  is written in graffiti marker over it.  a violin overlaid on a kick drum plays on loop.   vague gestures towards religious and historical figures.  the aspirations of revolution, transcendence, and meaning sold as a commercial product.  i think i have developed a perverse appreciation for coldplay because of this.  a paradoxical loop of revulsion and attraction <br><br>

      	when i check the news now, i’m not really hunting for any tidbits of “the new” anymore.  it’s more like i’m just checking in to see if all the patterns are still there.  you know, conservative news outlets blaming minorities,  billionaires destroying the social fabric of america, AI replacing even more jobs, the usual “conflict in the middle east” articles, etc.  besides that healthcare ceo getting popped in the head, nothing interesting has happened since last december.  oh well

      	why am I still writing this diary in HTML? I guess it’s for the weird sense of validation I get when I see my diary entries inside of a web browser that can be visited by anyone. But why should I be striving for validation when I write in my diary?  <br><br>

      	bit of an odd thing to be driven towards isn’t it? Even an object as intimate as a diary still involves a strange sense of validation for me. The fact that I feel that a small number of people can visit these thoughts anytime does shape the direction of this diary.  typing out my thoughts allows me to capture the rawness of my emotion, but sometimes the emotion is a bit too raw.

      	i guess i kind of realized why i’m still writing this diary in html.  growing up, i’ve seen too many people my age write really angry sounding manifestos and then go on to commit terrible acts.  perhaps this method of (somewhat) open sourcing my diary to my close friends is a way of keeping myself in check.  i’ve already had a couple of people in the past tell me how upset i sounded in earlier entries (someone described an earlier version of this diary as a really long suicide note).  <br><br>

      	this diary kind of began as a joke but i’m grateful for the perspective it’s given me on my own psyche.  i’m also glad for this new sense of accountability that has developed in my life since there might be other people reading this diary

      	one of the strangest pleasures for me in modernity is how people “dress up” their computers.  by computers, i don’t just mean laptops, but phones as well.  i don’t really see this with older people, but i always see stickers over my friend’s laptops and phones, post it notes on laptop palm rests, polaroids stuck inside of their phone cases, laptop and keyboard covers that coordinate with their preferred color palette.  <br><br>

      	i love that.  it says so much about a person when they can just take a godlike tool and put hello kitty stickers all over it.  think about it.  people half a century ago would not believe that our phones could easily outperform ibm mainframes in terms of storage or computing power.

		reconnected with an old friend over coffee today (we go all the way back to kindergarten).  poor guy was fentanyl for half a decade.  he said that the first few months were indescribable but after that, you’re just “chasing the dragon.”  he went to rehab and he’s clean now but we got to talking about this “death drive” that men tend to have.  one should be exposed to these edge of life experiences occasionally.  <br><br>

		during our conversation, we also discovered that we both watched “gore videos” when we were teenagers.  i described to him one video that i had refused to watch all those years ago ( i think it was a cartel video in which they cut off a man’s face ) and he had actually seen that video and described to me how they took off the guy’s face and wore it like a mask.  we had both seen a good number of those liveleak videos from china where guys get sucked into machines.. . .that was a strange touchpoint in our conversation. <br><br>

		now that i think about it, this conversation would probably be disgustingly morbid to the average person, but it felt healing in a way.  there is a kind of strange beauty that hangs in the air like a thick fog when i have these rare conversations.

		met up with some friends for pool downtown .  one of them reserved a table for $10, then we sat in another room and decided to leave without playing pool.  arrived at a winery.  was there a week ago.  pretty neat place.  saw another friend there that we bumped into last week.  crazy.  had a good time (and a bit of mead) at the winery.  the friend we bumped into at the winery invited us to an “introvert hangout” down the street at a place that sold a drink called “kava.”  kava?  cool!  maybe it’s like jamba juice or something.  <br><br>

		we walk there and that’s when suddenly everyone starts misinterpreting each other (lol).  suddenly people start wagging their fingers at each other and i get thrown into the mix too (double lol).  we arrive at the kava place down the street and things became even more strange.  i order a kava drink.  no idea what it is so i ask for the “traditional” flavor.  i didn’t know any of these new people and i wasn’t really positioned at a part of the table that was easy for me to engage with these introvert people.  <br><br>

		so i get my kava from the counter and suddenly the friend who invited us to this introvert meetup is reprimanding me for not talking or engaging with these new introvert people.  i still have no idea what’s going on so i start drinking my kava.  my god.  this  tastes like dirt.  or roots.  or roots covered in dirt.  anyway, the person who invited us moves on from reprimanding me about not engaging with the introverts to reprimanding me about slurping my kava loudly, since i guess their autism makes them super sensitive to mouth noises like slurping and other things.  <br><br>

		at this point, i had finished half of my cup of this dirt water and suddenly my tongue and the inside of my mouth go numb.  cottonmouth??  i thought this was just a health drink or something?  my friend from pool pulls up the wikipedia page for kava on her phone and it turns out it has “mildly sedative, anesthetic, psychoactive, and euphoric properties.”  oh boy.  <br><br>

		anyway, i start trying to fight the cottonmouth by sticking my tongue out of my mouth and i’m smacking my lips when i see this person staring at me again.  oh yeah.  the mouth noises and whatnot.<br><br>

		  man.  <br><br>

		at this point, the kava has fully kicked in so i don’t even hear words coming out of their mouth, i just hear really angry chirping, as if i accidentally disturbed some poor bird’s nest.  i guess some other things happened that night, but i think i’ll end this entry here.

      	you know, the paper that my friend ben wrote about my work…..  in it, he describes my process and notes that although i allow the neural network to make aesthetic choices in the work, my hand still has the final say, as i integrate the output of the neural network back into my drawing and do some color correction in photoshop.  however, now when i think about it, that might not be the case..  when i upload any of my work to the internet (no matter how *self aware* or *intellectual * it is about artificial intelligence) the image is still funneled through a series of algorithms well outside of my control.  also these tech companies are already training user content in their language and image generation models. the AI in fact still has control over me and control over the spread of my work;  buh-buh-but ernest!  these ai algorithms are still ran and maintained by *human* engineers and tech ceos!  sure, but how many of these people are entranced by ideas of agi or asi or “the singularity?” or maybe they’re motivated by some abstract sci fi concept like roko’s basilisk.  oh well.  i think being alive today is cool.  i’m literally living in the world that sci fi writers were pining about decades and decades ago.  <br><br>

		i still remember those nights staying up until 3 am training pix2pix models locally on my laptop.  like staying up late to change the baby’s diaper.  except instead of changing diapers, i was rebooting my laptop because vs code wouldn’t stop crashing.  i just feel so grateful that this all happened

		haha.  this takes me back to a graduate critique i had on my work (my hand drawn landscapes juxtaposed with pix2pix output) and one of the panelists nervously asked “you’re not one of those transhumanist people.. are you?” to which i chuckled and said no.  looks like i changed my mind<br><br>

      	however, i noticed that i've been listening to classical music more often only because it’s written and performed by humans.  less to do about the composition or the arrangement to be honest.  i am exposed to so much ai slop nowadays, anything that was created by a human feels like a nice reprieve.  i'm not joking.  i got into webern recently just because i can actually hear *him*! in the piece.  and i thought i didn't like 12 tone music!  maybe this whole slop assualt on society is getting me to think about art in deeper, profound ways.  <br><br>

      <h2>february 3rd, 2025</h2>

      <p>

      	now this is where i am going to think dialectically about ai generated video and imagery as a part of some larger creative process instead of “the end of creativity as we know it.”  perhaps ai generated content/slop isn’t all bad.  “slop” has existed long before ai even hit the scene.  have you ever seen a grid layout of all those hallmark christmas movies?  all the covers look the same.  pretty sure all the plots are the same too.  so much human effort and labor put into producing hallmark slop...  similar to how photography freed painters from realism and “academic painting,” i feel that ai is going to free us from stylistic or narrative “cliches.”  <br><br>

      	ai will push actual artists to create work that is so forward thinking and intimate that it might hurt a little bit.  similar to how impressionists took the camera as a nudge towards abstraction, perhaps artists in my generation will take ai as a nudge to explore our inner worlds more deeply.  ai is fantastic at taking representations of the external world and creating an “average” of all those representations.  <br><br>

      	but nothing beats art made by an individual that is a cultural product of their specific time and place.  mcdonald’s exists in the same world where michelin star restaurants also exist.  ai isn’t too bad<br><br>

      	got a job as an art teacher recently!  teaching kids.   learning to shed the cool detached/aloof  shithead artist persona i developed after hanging around graduate students for 2 years.  today, i was projecting “the roses of heliogabalus” by alma taldema on the whiteboard.  let them draw all over the painting with whiteboard markers.  also showed them “metamorphoses” by escher.  one last image i projected was the album cover for “LP1” by fka twigs.  there’s one kid named jaxon who’s really rowdy but the moment i displayed that image, he was frozen, almost lovestruck by the album cover.<br><br>
		i also see my other coworkers wholeheartedly embracing the children and their interests.  realized that i would be all the better for it if i just drop the facade and fully engage with other people and be present.  specifically my coworker Casey.  god what a guy.  he’s so honest and forward, i wish i could be more like him.  i can tell he genuinely enjoys interacting with the students and i can’t detect a single drop of ennui or elitism in him at all.

"denial of death."  pretty good book.  it's cool how he can weave in kierkegaard's and freud's theories into each other.  i mean, he's kinda dunking on freud, but respectfully.  like, you know how basically, with freud, it all goes back to sexuality?  like oral stuff, anal stuff, fixations, castration stuff, whatever.  becker  thinks humans are more controlled by death more than sexuality.  apparently there's another guy named otto rank who he quotes but i either can't remember his points or i haven't reached his part in the book yet.  <br><br>

          just sent my application to MIT’s graduate architecture program this afternoon.  however i have another order of business to attend to.  gotta warm myself up for something that’s been weighing on me for a while.  my father being the paranoid conservative he is bought a handgun a few years ago and it’s just been sitting in a drawer in his bedroom.   for the past few days, i would take the gun out of the case and rub the barrel of the gun against the middle of my forehead.  how sad, i don’t even have the independence to buy my own gun.  it’s unloaded, obviously, but i just felt like i needed to feel some cold metal against my head just to remind myself what i need to do in a few months.  i can’t off myself now, because i still need some closure from MIT when they eventually reject me in april so that gives me a few months to actually read hegel’s phenomenology of spirit to see what all the fuss is about.

        i started writing this diary in the midst of a deep malaise but i see no reason to continue it any further.  my artworks and compositions will function as my diary entries from this point.<br><br><br><br>

        also how arrogant of me to assume that i could even finish a sizable chunk of phenomenology of spirit in three months.  i set aside 2-3 days a week just to read that book and i only just finished reading the introduction after being stuck in the preface.
