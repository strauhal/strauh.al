    "quote": "“This will to life was well understood by Spinoza too. He said the very essence of man is desire - the desire to persist in his existence. That is the essence of what you and I are. You might try and put all kinds of fancy wrapping around it, but when it comes down to it, we may do some unspeakable things if it means that we continue with our existence. This desire for survival is not a passive kind of thing. It says that people are desperate for more experience, they want more of life, they want to visit more places, acquire more stuff, more money, they want more power because all these things enhance their potential in life and that is what most of us are after. Personally, I'm not really after all that, I've been there done it - got the T-shirt as they say, and I found it all boring, dull and unsatisfying. But most people go after that, people who've got a billion dollars want ten billion dollars. People who employ 500 people want to hire 5000 people, just because of the power it gives them. It's endless and you see it in the animal[…]”"

    "quote": "“Art, however, is social not only because of its mode of production, in which the dialectic of the forces and relations of production is concentrated, nor simply because of the social derivation of its thematic material. Much more importantly, art becomes social by its opposition to society, and it occupies this position only as autonomous art. By crystallizing itself as something unique to itself, rather than complying with existing social norms and qualifying as “socially useful,\" it criticizes society by merely existing, for which puritans of all stripes condemn it. There is nothing pure, nothing structured strictly according to its own immanent law, that does not implicitly criticize the debasement of a situation evolving in the direction of a total exchange society in which everything is heteronomously defined. Art's asociality is the determinate negation of a determinate society. Certainly through its refusal of society, which is equivalent to sublimation through the law of form, autonomous art makes itself a vehicle of ideology: The society at which it shudders is left in the distance, undisturbed. Yet this is more than ideology: Society is not only the negativity that the aesthetic law of form condemns but also, even in its most objectionable shape, the quintessence of self-producing and self-reproducing human life. Art was no more able to dispense with this element than with critique until that moment when the social process revealed itself as one of self-annihilation; and it is not in the power of art, which does not make judgments, to separate these two elements intentionally. A pure productive force such as that of the aesthetic, once freed from heteronomous control, is objectively the counterimage of enchained forces, but it is also the paradigm of fateful, self-interested doings. Art keeps itself alive through its social force of resistance; unless it reifies itself, it becomes a commodity. Its contribution to society is not communication with it but rather something extremely mediated: It is resistance in which, by virtue of inner-aesthetic development, social development is reproduced without being imitated. At the risk of its self-alienation, radical modernity preserves art's immanence by admitting society only in an obscured form, as in the dreams with which artworks have always been compared.”"

    "quote": "“It’s like a surface gleaning of little digital MP3 gems, and you’re harvesting them in and then, ‘Oh, this Josquin des Prez is the most beautiful ruby I saw,’” says Hecker of discovering the Franco-Flemish composer whose work he adapted for Love Streams. Regarded as one of the most prolific and inventive Renaissance composers, des Prez is celebrated for his innovations in polyphonic vocal music made around the turn of the 16th century. Hecker, whose studio-based process is rooted in the structureless atmospherics of psychoacoustics referred to as ‘ambient’, has only recently begun to work with the voice as a material. “It’s that kind of very naïve, playful gleaning of this beautiful digital audio surface in the infinite MP3 archives,” he says, “or something like that.”"

Is there any way you prepare yourself for getting into the practice of music-making, or do you just crack your knuckles and give'r?    TH: Studio work is a kind of mix of dull, bludgeoning, plodding, getting-nowhere feelings of hitting your head against the wall, mixed with these amazingly crystallized moments of epiphany and revelation and vision. You never know when those things are going to happen. I personally can’t find a process where I can trigger that state of finding that kind of magic. Because if it was so easy then it’d be preset-based - and if it’s preset-based then it could be done very easily by anybody. [But] it’s something that really comes with hard work and labour and time and patience, and being open to your music spiraling off on different tangents and going with it, and not being sentimental about music that’s not quite there. Just destroying it."

    "quote": "According to Kojève, this constitutes the first time in our history a new phase stratified between the master, who was recognised and slave, who gave the recognition. For Kojève, master and slave are not natural categories, as is for Aristotle, rather they are historical categories. They are historically constituted in this free, spontaneous moment of freely given recognition. But as history unfolds, the master is not satisfied. He did not get what he wanted because he doesn’t want the recognition of the inferior slave. He wants to be recognised by someone worthy of granting him that recognition. So, the master finds himself in an impasse.      By contrast, the slave is doing what the master wants him to do. He is productive, acquiring new skills and learning new skills to transform the natural world through his labour. In transforming the natural world, the slave realises that he is not naturally bound to his animality. That he is, in fact, free with respect to nature. In this regard, he will transcend his natural environment through his labour. This newly gained insight, Kojève argues, gives rise to a new self-consciousness that gets the motor of history going.      In the end, there is a dialectical reversal of history. For Kojève, history belongs to slaves, not to masters. The position of the master is fixed; he cannot transcend the world around him. He remains deprived of satisfaction. On the other hand, the slaves transcend and transform their surroundings through labour, creating a world in which they will be free. In transforming the world by his work, the slave transforms himself, creating a new condition that will permit him to take up once again the liberating fight for recognition (pg29)."

    "quote": "Being dubious about the sound and culture of ambient music (which you could just as easily call ‘bro music’ based on the dominant demographic of its producers), I’m prepared to be affronted by Hecker from the outset. A recently published book by Seth Kim-Cohen called Against Ambience gave me fresh validation in my general distaste for ambient; its gesture towards political transcendence and disregard for social responsibility being exposed as a luxury enjoyed by people of privilege. But Hecker is an artist who isn’t stupid. In fact he’s very smart, and pretty self-aware. “I mean, that sounds to me like a rehash of the Adorno-Benjamin debates in the 1930s about politics and art,” he responds when I lay out the book’s criticisms, “and [whether] art exists autonomously from the burden of politics and struggle, and a whole bunch of societal issues. I don’t know, I need to read that article, because to me that doesn’t sound like anything particularly fresh.”"

    "quote": "Charles “Charley” Strauhal was born in Long Beach, WA, on February 12, 1895. His parents, Walter and Eva Strauhal, owned and operated the Strauhal Store in Long Beach. He bought his first car from Milton York and was married that same year when he was seventeen and divorced not long after. In 1917, he enlisted in WWI through the Oregon Ambulance Corps and served in France and Belgium, where he earned a reputation for his bravery and daring.      After the war, he worked in his father’s store. He married his second wife and moved to Ilwaco, working for the power company as a lineman. Later he operated the Ilwaco and Long Beach movie theaters for several years before being appointed Deputy Sheriff for the peninsula. He was highly respected as an officer of the law and admired for his “nonchalant fearlessness.”      Frequently seen zooming up and down the roads of the peninsula in his Stutz Bearcat, a high-powered, expensive automobile, he was often reported on in the newspapers driving at high speeds through the local towns. He also earned his pilot’s license and owned a Waco 10 bi-plane, which he kept at the Ilwaco Airport.      It was common practice at the time here for pilots to use the weather beach as a runway. On the afternoon of March 21, 1934, Charley prepared to give an airplane ride to his friend, Long Beach Police Chief Gus Schultz. The two officers were flying about 200 feet above the beach when the motor began cutting out. In the forced landing that followed, the plane nosed down and burst into flames when it struck, killing both men. One of the many who witnessed the accident was Charley’s mother. She attempted to reach the crash, but was overcome with grief and shock and fell unconscious, remaining so for nearly 24 hours. He was survived by his wife Marion, son Charles, Jr., and his parents.      Charles Strauhal was given a full military burial at the Ilwaco Cemetery attended by hundreds of mourners. He was a member of the Don R. Grable Post of the American Legion, as well as the VFW post in Long Beach, which is named in his honor.

To paint a flower there is no need to perfectly match its petals and colors, but it is essential to convey its liveliness and fragrance."

This knot, net or web metaphor also conveys the Buddhist teaching of interpenetration.[citation needed]. It is also an attribute of the god Vishnu, which is said to be engraved on his chest. A similar engraving of the Shrivatsa on the historical Gautama Buddha's chest is mentioned in some lists of the Physical characteristics of the Buddha."

    "quote": "Hearing the difference now isn't the reason to encode to FLAC. FLAC uses lossless compression, while MP3 is 'lossy'. What this means is that for each year the MP3 sits on your hard drive, it will lose roughly 12kbps, assuming you have SATA - it's about 15kbps on IDE, but only 7kbps on SCSI, due to rotational velocidensity. You don't want to know how much worse it is on CD-ROM or other optical media. I started collecting MP3s in about 2001, and if I try to play any of the tracks I downloaded back then, even the stuff I grabbed at 320kbps, they just sound like crap. The bass is terrible, the midrange...well don't get me started. Some of those albums have degraded down to 32 or even 16kbps. FLAC rips from the same period still sound great, even if they weren't stored correctly, in a cool, dry place. Seriously, stick to FLAC, you may not be able to hear the difference now, but in a year or two, you'll be glad you did."

    "quote": "I do actually think that most human behavior is fundamentally reducible to algorithms. The confines of the individual ego are not as vast and infinite as the timeless void that spawned it. If each individual life is finite in scope, it's fair to assume all the possible configurations of that life -- including all of its egoistic disturbances and nuances -- are distillable into patterns of behavior that can be catalogued and understood over a long enough time period.      Perhaps you resist being understood by others because that too is a mechanism of defense. A means of hanging on to a sense of personal ownership and an internal sense of control? You seem to dislike the idea of being known, analyzed or understood by the other. Why is that?"

    "quote": "I then decided to add an offshoot to my ongoing creative writing project — I wanted to take a closer look at how well AI can create authentic writing. For my study, I chose to focus on poetry. Unlike other AI-generated writing, poetry is significantly more challenging for AI to generate authentically. Harvard student Maya Bodnick found that AI-generated essays easily passed all her freshman year classes, for example. But unlike in essays, a major component of poetry is human emotion, which AI intrinsically lacks. Keith Holyoak in the MIT Press Reader writes that “poetry may serve as a kind of canary in the coal mine — an early indicator of the extent to which AI promises (threatens?) to challenge humans as artistic creators.”"

    "quote": "I'm just here to repeat what I've already said the previous thread. I've studied music, music theory, music history, etc. and I've had close encounters with contemporary composers. They're pretentious fucks and absolute charlatans and 99.9% of contemporary art music fucking sucks. They will do all sorts of mental gymnastics to justify their completely vertical and formless garbage sounding art.      The biggest cope they have is the notion that music and the arts are exactly like science and technology, i.e. that they're progressing linearly and that each next step means a better and more enlightened world. By this logic, music is only getting better with time, and all these people are contributing positively simply by exploring \"new sounds\" (replace \"sounds\" with extended techniques, forms of expression, or any other buzzword). No matter the final sonic result from the perspective of beauty or the reception of it (as if anybody normal actually wants to listen to this crap, it's just a circle jerk between other composers, musicologists, and critics), experimenting with sounds can be only be a good thing.      It's funny that I studied all of this and I've only grown to dislike art, artists, concert venues, museums, state-funded programs, etc. At least now I have a degree and I can say with complete confidence what everyone is thinking but are too scared to say because they get immediately shut down by the people who profit from this, i.e. the institutions and composers who suck on government funding and support, and the musicologists and critics who actually get paid to analyze and talk about this crap."

    "quote": "It's just not really all that true. The more you read, the more you start to realize that the older stuff is where it's at if you're looking for complex characters, moral grayness, and so on and so forth. There will be anons who argue that older literature is just more realistic, especially if they're Christians, but I don't think they're right. Sure, modern literature may dazzle its readers with ambiguities, but in most cases those ambiguities are presented to the reader to evoke a certain reaction regardless; the author is still saying to his audience \"You probably feel really bad about this, don't you?\" or \"Isn't this so bittersweet?\". The binary of Good vs. Evil is still there, just hidden behind a vomit of gray paint. It doesn't help that most authors nowadays don't actually know their subjects all that well. You can only dig so deep with a surface-level understanding, after all. If anything, modern literature is more true to the argument of those anons, even if it's not honest about it. I don't hate modern literature, though. I just don't like it when authors do the equivalent of handing the player of an RPG multiple choices only for them all to have the exact same outcome."

I was in [the costume] all that day, and then they said, “We’re going to have a group prayer about 9/11.” And I couldn’t get the thing — I would’ve held everyone for a half-hour getting all that prosthetic makeup off — so, as I remember it, everyone else was [wearing] civilian clothes, I’m dressed as the Turtle Man, with a bald head, and I’m holding hands, and I’m lowering my head and praying, and I just thought at the moment: “This is very strange.”"

He knows neither how to sing nor how to philosophize. He knows how to paint, and that’s it.” No moralizing veil overlays Manet’s images, which are not allegorical or drawn from history. Manet paints scenes from his social environment, but not as a documentarian. He cares about the image, the experience of beholding the image, and the paint."

    "quote": "One humbling thing I learned from composition was that if your piece is really good, orchestras will want to play it. Beyond the standard advice of writing for standard groups (i.e. don’t write for 14 oboes and chain saw), and assuming you’ve written idiomatic material for each instrument (i.e. stuff that’s not insanely difficult just to be difficult), and importantly, writing music that people actually want to hear (i.e. the atonal/serialism stuff only survives in the dusty halls of academia), then it’s a matter of picking up the phone and sending letters and doing the boring busy work of contacting conductors. College campuses often have more wind bands these days, so you may find that you want to consider reworking the piece for the groups that are available (it’s so much more work if you need to assemble a fully custom group than if you can write for common instrument groups). You can always ask for feedback first — i.e. start your letter with something like “I’m a composer writing for orchestra and I am wondering if you would be willing to look over one of my recent pieces and provide feedback as to its suitability for performance.” That way you’re not pressuring them to perform it directly, and they can offer constructive feedback on why it might or might not work, and who knows, if they really like it, they might offer to play it."

Stromae another rapper from belgium posted a new song Fils de joie which means kid of joy, there were a lot of hints about a baby born later came the hints about me being a jew, my family think I’m a muslim I was thinking I’m an agnostic, I never included anything jew in my culture or my personality, the first hint was the following :      Go slow here. Very immaculately slow. I was in a train station waiting for a train to go to Paris. My phone was in my bag. My phone cant be found in the bag. I searched its nowhere I lost it. How I lost it ? I’m a data scientist from a major french Grande École ivy league shit I KNOW NOTHING CAN GO MOVE FASTER THAN SPEED OF LIGHT IM A SCIENTIST OKAY? We are left with what logic suggest my phone was stolen. Great. We have our answer. Even though it was in my bag the whole time and I confirm it not being stolen. Let’s forget about this detail and say a person did stole my iPhone. You can’t open an iPhone. You can flash it and restart it maybe. You can’t access the data inside the phone. What technology you could need to take an iphone and open it like no password exist or no engineering happen at Apple? Say you have it, you a thief. Okay you opened my phone now what are you gonna do ?      My family name in arabic translates to “The Highest Thing”, why would you a thief after accessing my iphone change my Facebook and Instagram name to Jed Mlih which translates from arabic to “Good grandfather”, the jew thing is “Mlih” which means “Good” is a JEW family name, every city in Morocco have a jew neighbourhood called “Lmlah” “The Mlih”, it’s the Arabic equivalent of Cohen or Rothschild, I was also told in psychiatry by a random person that I’m hated because I’m jew. I later saw on Twitter someone yelling at a famous Jew Street talker that jews “do magic on the boat”, same reference from the rapper and it’s just the tip of the iceberg, the window under my building window had a mouse pad and a plastic small boat, it meant you are navigating and surfing, I didn’t had the knowledge back then to figure out what was going I was just scared as fuck it was very hard to understand and correlate between events. I still fail to talk about this experience. I was told by a random person mocking me that “it’s good to go to school” by that I understood boy you have no chance understanding what’s going on right now, not now for sure.    A demiurge. A pharoah. An alien. A jew. A slave. A son of the devil.    Immaterial existence use playable characters to deliver information and communicate with me. I hope you are smart enough to understand: nobody knows who I am yet everybody is acting in an unbelievable way for thing to coincide. Some people knew what was going on like the rappers I mentioned, that an alien is gonna be born and that he gonna experience out of the world interactions with the world. Some playable characters did just act without knowing.    Don’t stop at the comments it’s the tip of the tip of the iceberg I can’t put it an swallowing context.

For ease of reading and without anyone telling me, I instinctively and autistically set my stuff to plain bold Arial 12 pt, black letter on plain white background. The women tended to clutter their e-mails with flowers, patterned backgrounds, decorations and other bullshit, daily financials/marketing reports, etc. This was tolerated for a time, but eventually the male CEO (whose e-mail non-style was close to mine) had to tell them to dial the flowers and bullshit back (without using those words) because it was getting in the way of ease of use, legibility and plain reading/communication. He did not single me out as an example of what TO do, and I was pleased about this (He was sharp enough to understand that doing that might have triggered some resentment in my direction). I was also privately pleased that he sent out that memo, as I myself eventually found the decorations to be distracting from whatever the main points in a given e-mail were."

The future you're describing is inconsistent with human nature - when things are too easy, too simple, too perfect, we will destroy it just to learn the meaning of struggle once more.      Let's also not hold foolish belief that art is graded on a 10 point line where 0 is bad and 10 is perfect. I like The Great Wave better than the Mona Lisa, but the Louvre disagrees with my taste that fractals hold more beauty than Vinki's oneitis.

One last point - knowing about music theory and having instrument skills would help you guide any AI tool to develop your ideas in the direction you want. Got a cool riff/lick/beat and need something to shift to retain interest? Use it as an audio prompt to generate some ideas, take what you like best and then tweak it until it's yours.

Keep in mind that this was written circa 550 CE and refers to \"old\" and \"ancient\" practices. The six elements that define a painting are:      1. \"Spirit Resonance\", or vitality, which refers to the flow of energy that encompasses theme, work, and artist. Xie He said that without Spirit Resonance, there was no need to look further.    2. \"Bone Method\", or the way of using the brush, refers not only to texture and brush stroke, but to the close link between handwriting and personality. In his day, the art of calligraphy was inseparable from painting.    3. \"Correspondence to the Object\", or the depicting of form, which would include shape and line.    4. \"Suitability to Type\", or the application of color, including layers, value, and tone.    5. \"Division and Planning\", or placing and arrangement, corresponding to composition, space, and depth.    6. \"Transmission by Copying\", or the copying of models, not from life only but also from the works of antiquity."

    "quote": "The age old question: Do dogs have Buddha Nature?     I’m not sure, but I think cats might.     My cat Calvin recently taught me a lesson about non-self that I’d like to share with y’all.     I finished doing the dishes and whipped around to grab a towel. Usually I check for my cat first, but this time I didn’t and he happened to be underfoot. He yowled as I stepped on his back paw, then darted off into the basement.     I apologized profusely and checked/monitored the foot for damage, which there was none      He quickly forgave me (or so I thought!); we went on to have a normal evening, watching TikTok while he purred in my lap.     He gave me no sass, was not fearful; clearly there was no grudge against my person from his end.     The next day, we were in the kitchen. I placed a bowl of fresh food down on the floor for him. He started gobbling with his usual zeal, and I turned to clean the dishes.     As soon as the sink started, he bolted.     Now he looked at me with fear from the other room, “how could you?” plastered on his face. I brought his food to the other room, finished the dishes, and we hung out like normal the rest of the night.     The day after that, the same thing happened; both of us in the kitchen, I turn to the dishes, he runs. He’s emotionally/temperamentally fine the rest of the evening. This pattern continued.     ~    What I find remarkable here is Calvin’s perception of trauma and selfhood.     When others hurt us, it’s easy to hold a grudge against them.    When I hurt Calvin, he could have formed a fear association with Daomin The Human Being. But instead, he formed an association to the specific conditions which led to pain.     He only displayed a fear response when we returned to a similar situation that brought pain in the first place. In all other conditions and situations involving me, he displayed no fear.     This is an astounding clarity of perception.     From this and other experiences, it’s clear to me that Calvin operates with a far less potent selfhood construct—    He does not associate fear with the construct of Daomin, but with the specific conditions that cause pain (which incidentally happen to include the construct we call Daomin, in a specific state).     He could’ve been like “Daomin hurt me!” But instead he was like “sink turned on + Daomin’s back showing == pain”    To see reality clearly is to see it stripped of the conceptions and constructions we build on top of it. Selfhood being one of the most potent.     Calvin is able to see clearly: the world is more of a flow of situations and conditions rather than agents. A process.     This opens up a “forgiveness”—if his concept of selfhood were more deeply lodged, he could have developed fear of ”me”, Daomin. But he’s able to forgive me instead—or more clearly, his mind doesn’t even go to blame “me” in the first place, rendering forgiveness unnecessary.    I think this has also allowed him to heal. Today, I can do the dishes with him in the kitchen just fine. Eventually he encountered the dishes situation without pain enough times to extinguish his fear. Who knows how long it would have taken if he associated his fear with me, rather than with the situation? What else would it have tangled with?"

    "quote": "The entropic brain hypothesis    The Entropic Brain Hypothesis, a Bayesian-Brain-based theory, emphasizes that the human brain operates on a spectrum between order and chaos. In our normal operating state, the mind is relatively ordered, because it is structured according to a particular worldview and belief structure.     The upside of this ordered cognitive structure is that it allows for consistent patterns of thought and behavior that are aligned with our established beliefs and expectations. The downside is that we are all trapped in one particular way of understanding the world, with a perspective that is inherently biased by our particular genes, life experiences, and the cultural beliefs of our “tribe.” So, although worldviews allow us to make predictions that help us navigate reality efficiently, they can also lock us into rigid, sometimes maladaptive, thought patterns and modes of behavior. And because neuroscience as a field has demonstrated a causal relationship between the brain and mind, we know that a rigid belief system corresponds to a relatively fixed pattern of neural connectivity."

    "quote": "The fundamental ego-substanceless-ness or not-self of all phenomena, anatta/anatman/nairatmya is the essence of Buddhist thought and what differentiates it from all other systems.    \"Nihilism\" comes from a few different readings. One is the Nietzschean, which interprets a general notion of Buddhism in alignment with Schopenhauer as a pessimistic doctrine of rejecting the world and thus considers it nihilism. But Nietzsche doesn't really care what Buddhism is per se and is using it as an example of world denial without ressentiment, to be contrasted with the Christian world denial, which is based on ressentiment. Nietzsche doesn't have access to substantial Mahayana literature that would expound on the non-duality of samsara and nirvana either, since this is decades away from getting translated and disseminated by indologists studying the prajnaparamita literature or by Japanese advocates of Zen. Understanding this, one would see it is not world denial, and there goes one form of nihilism.    Another nihilism charge is that of the theist opponent of the Buddhist. This should be extremely familiar, as in the West, extant Christians assume atheists are nihilists because they deny the ultimate reality of god. In Indian discourse this is Brahma(n) or Ishvara. The specifics don't matter much, it's enough that Buddhists deny a creator of the universe to be labeled as nihilists. This is a very foul smelling argument because it would suggest the theist only believes in god to avoid being called a nihilist. So if you want, you can pick up Nietzsche here even though he doesn't agree with Buddhism and use him as cudgel, since they were both arguing with some of the same priestly people who had ceded their power to evaluate to \"God.\"    Finally there are negating or apophatic doctrines like anatman or sunyata. Anatman is in every form of Buddhism and denies a permanent ego-substance or own self-nature. As you may recognize if you are familiar with Platonism, immortal souls and immortal God go hand in hand, so Buddhists are totally consistent here in saying no to both rather than picking and choosing. Madhyamaka is the school that makes sunyata its core and influences the rest of Mahayana Buddhism. This \"emptiness\" doctrine is really just an elaboration on anatman in its most basic sense, nothing has a self in the sense of that permanent enduring substratum. Nagarjuna is taken to be the founding thinker here, and for him and his tetralemma methodology, we cannot say of anything that it is x, not x, both x and not x, or neither x nor not-x, and this has been a nightmare of doxography ever since, with a long list of Indian, Tibetan, Chinese, Japanese, and also Korean Buddhists attempting to say \"yes, but how do I explain non-dualism using language?\" The consistent denial of any objects of discourse to be ultimately real is what gets this Buddhism called nihilism. But all Buddhists disagree that this is nihilism and provide many arguments to the contrary."

    "quote": "Vibratory or optical modes of perception refer to ways of experiencing the world that are not based solely on visual representation or intellectual understanding, but rather on a direct sensory or bodily experience. This concept is often associated with the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, who argued that perception is not just about the reception of information, but rather about the creation of new forms of experience.      In the context of art, vibratory or optical modes of perception refer to the way that certain artworks can produce sensations in the viewer that go beyond the visual representation of the work. For example, the abstract paintings of Wassily Kandinsky are often described as producing a sense of movement and vibration in the viewer, even though they do not represent any particular object or scene.      Bergson also explored similar ideas in his philosophy, arguing that perception is not a passive process of receiving information, but rather an active process of creating new forms of experience through the interaction of the body and the environment. In this view, perception is not limited to the five senses, but rather encompasses a range of bodily sensations and affects.      Through the lens of Deleuze, the vibratory or optical modes of perception are linked to the concept of the \"virtual,\" which refers to the potential for new forms of experience that are not yet realized in the actual world. By tapping into these virtual potentials, art can create new forms of perception that challenge our habitual ways of seeing and experiencing the world."

    "quote": "With AI art, the concept of the aura, as discussed by Walter Benjamin, undergoes a significant transformation. Benjamin argued that the aura of an artwork was its unique presence, tied to its originality, history, and the context of its creation. However, with AI-generated art, this aura is fundamentally altered.      Firstly, AI art lacks the traditional human touch and intentionality associated with the creation of art. In Benjamin's framework, the aura was deeply connected to the artist's individual expression and the labor involved in crafting the artwork. With AI, the creative process is automated and detached from human subjectivity, resulting in artworks that lack the aura born from human agency.      Secondly, AI-generated art often exists in a digital realm, further removing it from the tangible, physical context that Benjamin emphasized as integral to the aura. In the age of mechanical reproduction, Benjamin discussed how mass-produced copies diminished the aura of original artworks. With AI art, this process is taken to a new level, as digital files can be endlessly replicated and disseminated, diluting any sense of uniqueness or authenticity.      However, it's essential to note that while AI art may lack the traditional aura described by Benjamin, it generates new contexts and experiences. Some may argue that AI art possesses its own aura, shaped by the algorithms, data inputs, and the interactions between human creators and machine processes. In this sense, the aura of AI art is not necessarily absent but rather transformed, reflecting the unique dynamics of human-machine collaboration in the creative process."

    "quote": "Americans are, of course, the most thoroughly and passively indoctrinated people on earth. They know next to nothing as a rule about their own history, or the histories of other nations, or the histories of the various social movements that have risen and fallen in the past, and they certainly know little or nothing of the complexities and contradictions comprised within words like \"socialism\" and \"capitalism.\" Chiefly, what they have been trained not to know or even suspect is that, in many ways, they enjoy far fewer freedoms, and suffer under a more intrusive centralized state, than do the citizens of countries with more vigorous social-democratic institutions. This is at once the most comic and most tragic aspect of the excitable alarm that talk of social democracy or democratic socialism can elicit on these shores. An enormous number of Americans have been persuaded to believe that they are freer in the abstract than, say, Germans or Danes precisely because they possess far fewer freedoms in the concrete. They are far more vulnerable to medical and financial crisis, far more likely to receive inadequate health coverage, far more prone to irreparable insolvency, far more unprotected against predatory creditors, far more subject to income inequality, and so forth, while effectively paying more in tax (when one figures in federal, state, local, and sales taxes, and then compounds those by all the expenditures that in this country, as almost nowhere else, their taxes do not cover). One might think that a people who once rebelled against the mightiest empire on earth on the principle of no taxation without representation would not meekly accept taxation without adequate government services. But we accept what we have become used to, I suppose. Even so, one has to ask, what state apparatus in the \"free\" world could be more powerful and tyrannical than the one that taxes its citizens while providing no substantial civic benefits in return, solely in order to enrich a piratically overinflated military-industrial complex and to ease the tax burdens of the immensely wealthy?"

    "quote": "The current ruling ontology denies any possibility of a social causation of mental illness. The chemico-biologization of mental illness is of course strictly commensurate with its depoliticization. Considering mental illness an individual chemico-biological problem has enormous benefits for capitalism. First, it reinforces Capital's drive towards atomistic individualization (you are sick because of your brain chemistry). Second, it provides an enormously lucrative market in which multinational pharmaceutical companies can peddle their pharmaceuticals (we can cure you with our SSRIs). It goes without saying that all mental illnesses are neurologically instantiated, but this says nothing about their causation. If it is true, for instance, that depression is constituted by low serotonin levels, what still needs to be explained is why particular individuals have low levels of serotonin. This requires a social and political explanation; and the task of repoliticizing mental illness is an urgent one if the left wants to challenge capitalist realism."

The outfit was formed in Osaka, Japan in 1984 after Eye and Tabata met as stage hands at an Einstürzende Neubauten show. After the release of the first album, the \"I\" was dropped and the name became Hanatarash.    Hanatarash was notorious for its dangerous live shows. Some of the band's most infamous shows included Eye cutting a dead cat in half with a machete, strapping a circular saw to his back and almost cutting his leg off, and destroying part of a venue with a backhoe bulldozer by driving it through the back wall and onto the stage.    At a 1985 show in Tokyo's Superloft, the audience was required to fill out waivers due to the possibility of harm caused by the show. The show was stopped due to Eye preparing to throw a lit molotov cocktail onto the stage. The performance cost ¥600,000 (approximately $6,000 US) in repairs."

    "quote": "'Hobbies' today are essentially another form of Adorno's culture industry, where the actual content of the hobby becomes ultimately meaningless. The purpose of the hobby now becomes as a social marker, as a sort of modern caste-marker who's only real goal is to align you within a larger social group. 'Doing' the hobby is a kind of conspicuous consumption to claim a space within the social position, the people involved only perform the hobby as a signal that they have the intelligence, money, time, etc. needed to do it. This is why everyone interacts with their hobbies the same way. First is the basic level of performing the hobby, then the secondary levels around it, like purchasing new products for the hobby itself, purchasing ancillary products (like t-shirts or house decorations with hobby in jokes on them, for example), or attending meetings and conventions with other people involved in the hobby, all of which is further expansion of social position both within the hobby itself and within the wider culture. In other words, the work and money put in to the hobby allows you to claim the social rewards, both within the subculture and without, of an enhanced social position ('That guy plays the guitar, he's cool' \"She writes poetry, she's so deep').    However, since the performative stage of most traditional hobbies, like rock climbing or woodworking or, requires a base level of ability that not everyone has, the capitalist economy now provides hobbies based only around the secondary layers. This is why, increasingly, many people have hobbies of 'consuming' things. The stereotype is the fandom' where the performative layer of the hobby is based around consuming media and the real participation comes from buying things like posters and miniatures and so on, as well as strictly limited interactions with other fans where all conversation is limited to discussion of the media subject of the fandom. But now we are increasingly in a state where everything becomes a part of the 'hobby idea'. This is why OP's picture has people defining themselves by incredibly mundane, universal things like 'Food', 'Work', and 'Travel'."

It is the commodification of the human condition.

Look at all these Loomis books I've purchased and how many different types of pencils I have. Look at my ipad drawing set up and glove and proprietary brushes. Consume consume consume. I can't just read a book or watch a movie, I have to join the fandom and buy funkopops and go to conventions and buy the manga.

The only thing truly unique about you is the network of community you have built. The individuals who are themselves unique and how those relationships play out.    Corporations having you define yourself by the fender acoustic guitar that several hundred thousand other people own, playing covers that several million people have already played while drinking micro brews that thousands of others have drank is not a personality. It is not who you are. Everyone else is the same as you. You become a demographic when you define yourself this way. You are defined by the times you got drunk with uncle Steve and hung out with the boys.    Hobby culture is a capitalist blight to decouple you from your humanity. To make you a slave to your things.

Some successful artists are deeply insecure, self-sabotaging, struggling with addiction, or facing other obstacles to making and sharing their work.    An unhealthy self-image or a hardship in life can fuel great art, creating a deep well of insight and emotion for an artist to draw from. They can also get in the way of the artist being able to make many things over a long period of time.    People who are particularly challenged in this sense generally can't produce creative work over and over again. This isn't because they're not artistically capable, but because they were only able to break through their own issues one or two times and share great work.    One of the reasons so many great artists die of overdoses early in their lives is because they're using drugs to numb a very painful existence.

Each of the two beings endowed with such a Desire is ready to go all the way in pursuit of its satisfaction; that is, is ready to risk its life—and, consequently, to put the life of the other in danger—in order to be 'recognized' by the other, to impose itself on the other as the supreme value; accordingly, their meeting can only be a fight to the death. And it is only in and by such a fight that the human reality is begotten, formed,"

There remains money to be made in tailoring, much as I imagine there will be in art to either help 'inspire' the mass produced AI content, or to fulfil the needs of those who want something unique and hand crafted to a fine degree, but I don't imagine the industry will be the ones who push for this to happen, but rather the end consumers of content who may help to patronise a small handful of artists."

This liberates him from his sensuous condition in several respects: he no longer attempts to eat the wood; he shapes it and, once he has shaped it, he does not attempt to chase or eat the bison he has made, but contemplates it and offers it for the contemplation of others. He thus distances himself from sensuous desires and becomes capable of disinterested contemplation of the world as well as of appetitive consumption. His ability to restrain his desires enables him to see himself as more than a series of desires. Moreover, while the bison that he hunts and eats is a particular, individual bison, his carving is likely to represent, not some particular bison, but all and any of the bison that he has encountered and even of those that he has not yet encountered.

The absolute as the artist presents it lies at a depth below the sensuous surface of the world corresponding to the depth at which the mind of the artist (and, to a lesser degree, of his audience) lies below his physical and sensuous exterior, that aspect of him that is in immediate contact with the external world.

Art does not simply reveal God: it is one of the ways in which God reveals, and thus actualizes, himself. (iv) The absolute becomes self-conscious in man's cognitive and practical activities. But man's central motive for such activities is, in Hegel's view, to become self-conscious himself, and, since the absolute in this phase is not distinct from man, the absolute becomes self-conscious only in the self-consciousness of man.

And when we do this, something remarkable happens. Time, which so often feels like it is slipping through our fingers, begins to slow. Moments become rich, textured. Even the simplest of tasks takes on a new significance when approached with care, with attention."

The future shortens into a protracted present [Gegenwart]. It lacks all negativity, which would permit one to look at the Other [das Andere]. In contrast, rage puts the present as a whole into question. It presupposes an interrupting pause in the present. This is what distinguishes it from anger [Ärger]. The general distraction afflicting contemporary society does not allow the emphasis and energy of rage to arise. Rage is the capacity to interrupt a given state and make a new state begin. Today it is yielding more and more to offense or annoyance [Ärgernis], 'having a beef,' which proves incapable of effecting decisive change. In consequence, one is annoyed even by the inevitable. Annoyance relates to rage as fear relates to dread [Angst]. In contrast to fear, which concerns a determinate object, dread applies to Being-as-such. It grips and shakes the whole of existence. Nor does rage concern a discrete state of affairs. It negates the whole. Therein lies its negative energy. It represents"

Depression—which often culminates in burnout—follows from overexcited, overdriven, excessive self-reference that has assumed destructive traits. The exhausted, depressive achievement-subject grinds itself down, so to speak. It is tired, exhausted by itself, and at war with itself. Entirely incapable of stepping outward, of standing outside itself, of relying on the Other, on the world, it locks its jaws on itself; paradoxically, this leads the self to hollow and empty out. It wears out in a rat race it runs against itself."

The result is that, on the one hand, imagination with its whim and caprice, the organ, i.e., of artistic activity and enjoyment, remains excluded from science. On the other hand, they say that while art does brighten and vivify the unillumined and withered dryness of the Concept, does reconcile its abstractions and its conflict with reality, does enrich the Concept with reality, a purely intellectual treatment [of art] removes this means of enrichment, destroys it, and carries the Concept back to its simplicity without reality and to its shadowy abstractness. Further, in its content, science is occupied with what is inherently necessary. If aesthetics leaves natural beauty aside, we have in this respect apparently not only not gained anything, but rather have removed ourselves still further from the necessary.

However, any of them can easily leave the LCL and re-enter reality by visualizing their self as separate from others like Shinji did. The optimism comes from what the movie is trying to say. Shinji was given two options. On one hand, he could reject his worth as an individual and stay in the collective of the LCL. This would result in living in a world where Shinji would be completed by everyone else and thus conflict, internal and external, would cease to exist. In the LCL, people would live without pleasure or pain and would spend their days in the dreams they make up. The downside is that by giving up their individuality, they would also have no way to change the real world that matters, since it is literally just a soup of people. On the other hand, he could accept reality with all its pain and pleasure but also its ability to be changed to become better. By doing this, he would accept that he has self worth beyond others and thus a reason to live as a self rather than a collective. In the end, Shinji chooses reality. It should also be noted that instrumentality in Shinji's world is a stand-in for the audience using Evangelion as escapism in ours. We use the show to reject reality and enter a state where we can forget our personal pleasures and pains in the moment. We become a collective with the show but in doing so, reject our worth as an individual, at least in the moment, since we have no ability to effect what happens in the show, that's decided by others. Shinji parallels the decision that we can make, to reject the escapism, reaffirm our worth to change the world around us, even at the cost of pain and pleasure, and re-enter society."

This is why everything must be reinforced; he can have no traffic with ordinary women; Daisy cannot be just wonderful but must be perfect; the car and his clothes spotless; the parties the biggest; and the house bigger and better than everyone else's. The split in his inner life is reflected in his outer life. The novel is built on a pattern of surface and underground, bright and dull, cleanliness and dirtiness, white and dark. Gatsby wears white or pink suits; his shirts are beautiful; and only the telephone calls connect him to his sleazy underground. He lives on the fringes of the Buchanan's glamorous world and moves between the glamor of East and West egg and New York. The economic underground between them is the valley of ashes, where there is dirt, junk cars, pale faces, listless people and sex. Tom has no problem in stopping off at the valley of the ashes and embracing the \"dirty\" woman, Myrtle, and Nick, the voyeur, has no trouble accompanying him. But Gatsby's car spreads wings when it passes the valley of the ashes and Myrtle's smouldering sensuality. He wants nothing to do with the valley of ashes or the sexual woman who lives there. Gatsby wants to climb to the secret place above the trees and \"suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder\" (112) where Daisy and the saintly woman lives. The image is clearly sexual, though mixed with stardust and idealism, evoking the serene and ideal moment of the child at peace on his mother's breast.

Hence, we have the desire to live in a conflict-free existence, a life without danger or struggle, and all one has to do to obtain this existence is to give up their freedom and conform to the expectations of the Fascist leader. This desire for oppression isn't just a social function, but a psychological phenomenon spread and sustained by typical Freudian psychoanalysis, and it's concept of the 'Nuclear Family' - a mother, a father, and ourselves as the children. Through the heralding of an ideal family unit, people are taught to deny desire, to be ashamed of their sexual urges, any atypical fantasies or predilections, to give into their inclinations is perverted. For Deleuze and Guattari, traditional psychoanalysis is part of an entire social scheme dedicated to making people feel inferior, scared, and inadequate."

It is an intentionally achieved schizophrenia, with the expectation of a spontaneous remission—which, however, does not always follow. Yoga, too, is intentional schizophrenia: one breaks away from the world, plunging inward, and the ranges of vision experienced are in fact the same as those of a psychosis. But what, then, is the difference? What is the difference between a psychotic or LSD experience and a yogic, or a mystical? The plunges are all into the same deep inward sea; of that there can be no doubt. The symbolic figures encountered are in many instances identical (and I shall have something more to say about those in a moment). But there is an important difference. The difference—to put it sharply—is equivalent simply to that between a diver who can swim and one who cannot. The mystic, endowed with native talents for this sort of thing and following, stage by stage, the instruction of a master, enters the waters and finds he can swim; whereas the schizophrenic, unprepared, unguided, and ungifted, has fallen or has intentionally plunged, and is drowning.\" - Joseph Campbell, Myths to Live By"

    "quote": "A FATHER'S IMPACT  Education and neuroscience researchers report a father's engagement impacts a child's social and emotional competencies such as personal awareness, self-esteem, social skills, relationship building, decision-making, self-control and good behavior. A child's achievement in school is positively impacted when fathers take an active role in school-related events. Fathers who attend school meetings, participate in parent-teacher conferences, show support by attending school events or serve as school volunteers positively impact their child's academic achievement. Where in-school behavior is a concern, fathers can also effectively advocate for individualized discipline procedures and alternatives instead of accepting blanket punitive policies. However, when fathers are absent it produces disturbing outcomes.  Fatherless children are: twice as likely to drop out of school, twice as likely to go to jail, and four times more likely to need help with emotional or behavioral problems. Children who have a poor relationship with their father who lives in the household are 68% more likely to smoke, drink, or use drugs compared to teens living in emotionally healthy two-parent families. Adolescent boys living in single-parent families experience a higher risk of delinquency as well. Those raised without a father in their lives are twice as likely to end up in jail.  Children whose fathers are not present are twice as likely to repeat a grade.  71% percent of all high school dropouts were raised in fatherless homes (nine times the national average).  85% of children who exhibit behavioral disorders reside in fatherless homes.  63% of youth suicide are from fatherless homes.  70% of juveniles in state-operated institutions are from father-absent homes.  The balance between a mother's focus on nurturing and a father's emphasis on achievement works in tandem to foster the healthy growth and development of children. Whether a biological adoptive or stepfather, children whose fathers have been in their lives since infancy are more prone to be independent and emotionally secure. They are less likely to suffer from depression and are open to experiences outside of their comfort zone. Fathers who spend quality time at play with their children help reduce the incidence of behavioral problems among their sons and influence a healthy self-esteem among their daughters. Fathers' personal time with children enables young boys and girls to better manage their emotions and regulate their behavior. Fathers have significant influence over the development and health of their children. A child's identity is also enhanced, which bodes well for their attaining academic and career success. Adolescents whose fathers were involved during high school years were more likely to graduate from college."

The reason it's painful is the reason they became artists in the first place: their incredible sensitivity. If you see tremendous beauty or tremendous pain where other people see little or nothing at all, you're confronted with big feelings all the time. These emotions can be confusing and overwhelming. When those around you don't see what you see and feel what you feel, this can lead to a sense of isolation and a general feeling of not belonging, of otherness. These charged emotions, powerful when expressed in the work, are the same dark clouds that beg to be numbed to allow sleep or to get out of bed and face the day in the morning.

It introduces a clearness and order into the plenitude of thought, and in so doing gives stability to the ideas, and qualifies them at once for permanent and universal approval, for being followed by others, and for a continually progressive culture. And so, where the interests of both these qualities clash in a product, and there has to be a sacrifice of something, then it should rather be on the side of genius; and judgement, which in matters of fine art bases its decision on its own proper principles, will more readily endure an infringement of the freedom and wealth of the imagination, than that the understanding should be compromised.

I can guarantee most classical/jazz masterpieces began with the composer drunkenly fucking around on his instrument or randomly humming a melody. My proof for this is the fact that Jacob can give an in-depth theoretical analysis of any minute detail of his songs in a heartbeat.
