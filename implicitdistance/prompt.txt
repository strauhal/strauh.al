i have 5 mp3 stems that i want to play concurrently in a web browser.  each track is five minutes and 28 seconds long.  each mp3 file is around 3 megabytes so find an efficient way to load in the mp3 files.  when the user presses the spacebar, instead of moving the page down, i want the playhead to start moving.  i want a graphic representation of the waveform of the mp3 file to be displayed as shown in the mockup.  i also want play, pause, and stop buttons at the top.  the stop button will have restart all mp3 files to the start while play and pause are self explanatory.  i want a background of #00f and i want the waveforms to appear in #fff
